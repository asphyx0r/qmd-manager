# Tools

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

This directory contains repository management tools retained for QMD Manager.
Each tool is documented as an operational reference: what it does, how to run
it, which options it accepts, how it exits, and what practices keep usage safe.

## backup-target-directory.py

### Features

- Copies an entire source directory tree into a temporary staging directory.
- Includes Git metadata, hidden files, and tracked, untracked, or ignored files
  that are present during the copy.
- Creates a compressed ZIP archive in a separate existing target directory.
- Rejects symbolic links in the source tree.
- Names archives with the source directory, timestamp, Git `HEAD`, and an exact
  matching SemVer tag.
- Supports a side-effect-free dry run and an optional staging parent directory.

### Synopsis

```text
usage: python tools/backup-target-directory.py [options]

options:
  -h, --help                       show help and exit
  --version                        show version and exit
  --dry-run                        simulate execution without modifying data
  -v, --verbose                    enable DEBUG logs
  -d, --source-directory BASEDIR   existing source directory tree to back up
  -t, --target-directory TARGETDIR existing directory for the ZIP archive
  -b, --buffer-directory BUFFERDIR existing staging parent directory
```

### Description

`backup-target-directory.py` creates a staged ZIP backup of an existing
directory tree. The target and staging directories must remain outside the
source so the generated data cannot enter the backup. The script copies the
source to temporary staging before creating a same-directory temporary ZIP and
publishing the final archive.

When the source belongs to a readable Git repository, the archive name records
the 12-character abbreviated `HEAD`. It includes a SemVer tag only when that
tag points exactly to the captured commit. Every final archive uses this
format:

```text
<SOURCE>-<YYYYMMDD>-<HHMMSS>-<HEAD>-<SEMVER-TAG>.zip
```

For example:

```text
git-starter-kit-20260730-165813-0d3ae03a4a86-v2.0.3.zip
```

When no commit can be read, `<HEAD>` is `000000000000`. When no matching
SemVer tag can be read, `<SEMVER-TAG>` is `v0.0.0`. These placeholders keep
the filename structure stable.

After staging, the script resolves the source Git identity again. It stops
before ZIP creation if `HEAD` or the selected tag changed during the copy.

### Usage/Examples

Preview a backup of the current repository into an existing sibling
directory:

```bash
python tools/backup-target-directory.py \
  --dry-run \
  --source-directory . \
  --target-directory ../backups
```

Create the archive:

```bash
python tools/backup-target-directory.py \
  --source-directory . \
  --target-directory ../backups
```

Use an existing staging parent on another volume:

```bash
python tools/backup-target-directory.py \
  --source-directory . \
  --target-directory ../backups \
  --buffer-directory /path/to/staging
```

### Options

- `-h`, `--help`: prints the version and usage information, then exits.
- `--version`: prints script version `0.1.0`, then exits.
- `--dry-run`: validates the source, target, staging location, symbolic-link
  policy, Git identity, and final name without creating staging data or a ZIP.
- `-v`, `--verbose`: prints DEBUG logs in addition to normal status messages.
- `-d PATH`, `--source-directory PATH`: existing directory tree to back up.
  This option is required.
- `-t PATH`, `--target-directory PATH`: existing directory where the ZIP is
  created. This option is required and must not be inside the source.
- `-b PATH`, `--buffer-directory PATH`: optional existing staging parent. An
  unusable value produces a warning and falls back to the user temporary
  directory.

### Exit Status

- `0`: help or version was shown, the dry run completed, or the archive was
  created successfully.
- `1`: path or filesystem validation failed, a symbolic link was found, the
  Git identity changed during staging, or staging/archive creation failed.
- `2`: command-line argument parsing failed.

The script also refuses to run with effective user ID `0` on Linux.

### Appendix

This is a staged filesystem copy, not a transactional repository snapshot.
The post-copy check detects changes to `HEAD` or the selected tag, but not
concurrent edits to working-tree files, the index, other refs, or reflogs. Stop
repository writers while the backup runs when a restorable point-in-time copy
is required.

The archive includes `.git` when it is contained in the source. Linked
worktrees and submodules may instead use a `.git` file that refers to metadata
outside the source; such an archive is not self-contained.

ZIP preserves file bytes and modification times at ZIP precision, but this
tool does not preserve NTFS ACLs, alternate data streams, creation/access
times, or a cryptographic manifest. The `v0.0.0` placeholder is also
indistinguishable in the filename from a real tag with that exact name.

## git-init.ps1

### Features

- Initializes an existing non-empty directory as a Git repository.
- Previews committable files before creating target Git metadata.
- Requires explicit confirmation before initialization and commit.
- Warns before committing risky credential, archive, cache, or runtime paths.
- Creates the first Conventional Commit on `main`.
- Creates an annotated SemVer tag and optionally pushes to `origin`.

### Synopsis

```text
usage: powershell -NoProfile -File tools\git-init.ps1 [options]

options:
  -h, --help       show version and help
      --version    show version only
  -v, --verbose    show additional execution traces
  -p, --path PATH  target repository root, required
  -r, --remote URL optional origin remote URL
  -t, --tag TAG    SemVer Git tag, default: v1.0.0
```

### Description

`git-init.ps1` is the PowerShell initializer for creating the first Git history
in a target project directory. It requires the target directory to already
exist and contain files. If `.git` metadata already exists, it must be readable
and the repository must not already have commits.

The script asks for confirmation, previews files Git can commit, asks for a
second confirmation, warns on risky paths when needed, then creates the initial
commit, renames the branch to `main`, and creates an annotated tag. It pushes
only when `--remote` is provided.

### Usage/Examples

Initialize a local target directory:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -File tools\git-init.ps1 `
  --path ..\example-app `
  --tag v1.0.0
```

Initialize and push to a remote repository:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -File tools\git-init.ps1 `
  --path ..\example-app `
  --tag v1.0.0 `
  --remote https://github.com/example/example-app.git
```

Show version and help:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -File tools\git-init.ps1 --help
powershell -NoProfile -File tools\git-init.ps1 --version
```

### Options

- `-h`, `--help`: prints the version and usage information, then exits.
- `--version`: prints the script version, then exits.
- `-v`, `--verbose`: prints Git commands before running them.
- `-p PATH`, `--path PATH`: target repository root. This option is required.
  The path must be an existing non-empty directory.
- `-r URL`, `--remote URL`: optional remote URL. When provided, the script adds
  it as `origin` and runs `git push -u origin main --tags`.
- `-t TAG`, `--tag TAG`: annotated Git tag to create. Defaults to `v1.0.0`.
  The tag must be a SemVer tag prefixed with `v`.

### Exit Status

- `0`: help or version was shown, the user cancelled safely, or initialization
  completed successfully.
- Non-zero: an argument was invalid, the target directory was invalid, Git
  metadata was unreadable, the repository already had commits, the tag already
  existed, no committable files were found, Git failed, or another terminating
  PowerShell error occurred.

### Troubleshooting

When `git-init.ps1` comes from a downloaded GitHub release ZIP, PowerShell may
block it before the script starts. The error can be localized, but it usually
includes `PSSecurityException`, `UnauthorizedAccess`, and text similar to:

```text
.\git-init.ps1 : File C:\Path\To\Project\tools\git-init.ps1 cannot be loaded.
The file C:\Path\To\Project\tools\git-init.ps1 is not digitally signed. You
cannot run this script on the current system.
FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess
```

PowerShell is enforcing the current execution policy or the downloaded-file
mark on the extracted script. Inspect the active policies, then use a per-user
`RemoteSigned` policy and unblock the trusted script file:

```powershell
Get-ExecutionPolicy -List
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
Unblock-File -Path .\tools\git-init.ps1
powershell -NoProfile -File .\tools\git-init.ps1 `
  --path ..\example-app `
  --tag v1.0.0
```

Use the actual path where you extracted or copied `git-init.ps1`; for example,
replace `.\tools\git-init.ps1` with `.\scripts\git-init.ps1` if the script was
copied to `scripts`. Unblock only files from a trusted release package. If an
organization manages execution policy through `MachinePolicy` or `UserPolicy`,
follow that policy instead of bypassing it.

### Appendix

Review the file preview before confirming the commit. If risky paths are
reported, inspect them carefully and cancel unless they are intentional.

Use `--remote` only after checking that the target remote URL is correct. When
`--remote` is omitted, the initializer creates only local Git history.

Run from PowerShell when working primarily on Windows paths. Use
`git-init.sh` when a Bash environment is the better fit.

## git-init.sh

### Features

- Initializes an existing non-empty directory as a Git repository from Bash.
- Previews committable files before creating target Git metadata.
- Requires explicit confirmation before initialization and commit.
- Warns before committing risky credential, archive, cache, or runtime paths.
- Creates the first Conventional Commit on `main`.
- Creates an annotated SemVer tag and optionally pushes to `origin`.

### Synopsis

```text
usage: bash tools/git-init.sh [options]

options:
  -h, --help       show version and help
      --version    show version only
  -v, --verbose    show additional execution traces
  -p, --path PATH  target repository root, required
  -r, --remote URL optional origin remote URL
  -t, --tag TAG    SemVer Git tag, default: v1.0.0
```

### Description

`git-init.sh` is the Bash initializer for creating the first Git history in a
target project directory. It requires Bash 4 or newer, an existing non-empty
target directory, and readable `.git` metadata if `.git` already exists. The
target repository must not already have commits.

The script asks for confirmation, previews files Git can commit, asks for a
second confirmation, warns on risky paths when needed, then creates the initial
commit, renames the branch to `main`, and creates an annotated tag. It pushes
only when `--remote` is provided.

### Usage/Examples

Initialize a local target directory:

```bash
bash tools/git-init.sh --path ../example-app --tag v1.0.0
```

Initialize and push to a remote repository:

```bash
bash tools/git-init.sh \
  --path ../example-app \
  --tag v1.0.0 \
  --remote https://github.com/example/example-app.git
```

Show version and help:

```bash
bash tools/git-init.sh --help
bash tools/git-init.sh --version
```

### Options

- `-h`, `--help`: prints the version and usage information, then exits.
- `--version`: prints the script version, then exits.
- `-v`, `--verbose`: prints Git commands before running them.
- `-p PATH`, `--path PATH`: target repository root. This option is required.
  The path must be an existing non-empty directory.
- `-r URL`, `--remote URL`: optional remote URL. When provided, the script adds
  it as `origin` and runs `git push -u origin main --tags`.
- `-t TAG`, `--tag TAG`: annotated Git tag to create. Defaults to `v1.0.0`.
  The tag must be a SemVer tag prefixed with `v`.

### Exit Status

- `0`: help or version was shown, the user cancelled safely, or initialization
  completed successfully.
- `1`: an argument was invalid, the target directory was invalid, Git metadata
  was unreadable, the repository already had commits, the tag already existed,
  no committable files were found, Git failed, or another checked failure
  occurred.

### Appendix

Review the file preview before confirming the commit. If risky paths are
reported, inspect them carefully and cancel unless they are intentional.

Use `--remote` only after checking that the target remote URL is correct. When
`--remote` is omitted, the initializer creates only local Git history.

Run from Bash 4 or newer. On Windows, the PowerShell initializer may be easier
when the target path is a native Windows path.

## repository-audit.sh

### Features

- Runs the shared local and CI repository audit suite.
- Defaults to the full audit profile.
- Supports an optional read-only profile and focused CI audit modes.
- Checks Markdown, spelling, whitespace, shell scripts, PowerShell parsing,
  YAML, workflows, secrets, SemVer pattern drift, and commit messages.
- Parses every tracked or untracked non-ignored PowerShell file and runs the
  dependency-free `Initialize-QmdCollection` test suite.
- Bootstraps pinned tools and exercises mutating smoke cases only in full
  profiles.
- Uses WSL-aware temporary paths when Windows PowerShell is invoked from WSL.

### Synopsis

```text
usage: bash tools/repository-audit.sh [mode]

modes:
  all       run markdown, spelling, static, and smoke checks, default
  full      alias for all
  readonly  run non-mutating checks with installed tools
  markdown  run Markdown lint only
  spelling  run Codespell only
  static    run static checks and script smoke tests only
  -h        show help
  --help    show help
  help      show help
```

### Description

`repository-audit.sh` is the source of truth for repository validation. Its
default `all` mode and the explicit `full` alias run Markdown lint, spelling
checks, and static checks. The `static` mode includes Git whitespace checks,
Bash syntax checks, ShellCheck, PowerShell parsing, SemVer pattern drift
checks, QMD Manager tests, script smoke tests, Node syntax checks, and
commitlint validation for introduced commits.

The optional `readonly` mode uses only installed tools, disables optional Git
locks, and does not install packages, access the network, modify tracked files,
or run mutating smoke tests. It may create and remove isolated temporary files
for PowerShell parsing and QMD Manager tests. GitHub Actions calls explicit
focused modes.

### Usage/Examples

Run the default full audit:

```bash
bash tools/repository-audit.sh
```

Run the optional read-only audit:

```bash
bash tools/repository-audit.sh readonly
```

Run only Markdown checks:

```bash
bash tools/repository-audit.sh markdown
```

Run only spelling checks:

```bash
bash tools/repository-audit.sh spelling
```

Run static checks and smoke tests:

```bash
bash tools/repository-audit.sh static
```

### Options

- `all`: runs Markdown, spelling, static, and smoke checks. This is the default
  when no mode is provided.
- `full`: alias for `all`.
- `readonly`: runs non-mutating checks with installed tools.
- `markdown`: runs `markdownlint-cli2` against repository Markdown files.
- `spelling`: runs Codespell with the repository configuration.
- `static`: runs Git whitespace checks, Bash and ShellCheck checks,
  complete PowerShell parsing, QMD Manager tests, SemVer drift checks, script
  smoke tests, Node syntax checks, and commitlint checks.
- `-h`, `--help`, `help`: prints usage information, then exits.

### Exit Status

- `0`: the selected audit mode passed, or help was shown.
- `1`: an unknown mode was provided, a required command was missing, a
  validation check failed, a smoke test failed, or a bootstrapped tool failed.

### Appendix

Run the audit profile required for the operation before creating a release tag
or GitHub release. Treat any failure as a blocker until the underlying
validation issue is understood and fixed.

The full audit needs local tools such as `git`, `bash`, `shellcheck`, a
PowerShell command, `python`, `node`, and `npx`. It also needs network access
to npm for Markdown lint bootstrapping and PyPI for Codespell bootstrapping.

Use focused modes while diagnosing failures. For example, `markdown` and
`spelling` isolate documentation issues, while `static` isolates script,
configuration, and smoke-test behavior.

On Windows, Codex may repeatedly create Git processes while a repository is
open, as tracked in
[openai/codex#26812](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/26812). Treat this
as an external, mitigated defect: before write-sensitive Git operations,
inspect Git processes and lock files from a terminal outside Codex. If the
behavior recurs, close Codex normally. Never terminate a process or remove a
lock automatically; first confirm that it is orphaned and no active process
owns it.
