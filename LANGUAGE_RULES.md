# LANGUAGE_RULES.md

## Purpose

This file defines language-, dialect-, and framework-specific coding rules for
code generated or modified by an AI coding agent.

Use this file together with `AGENTS.md` and `CODING_RULES.md`:

- `AGENTS.md` governs agent behavior.
- `CODING_RULES.md` governs language-agnostic code quality.
- `LANGUAGE_RULES.md` governs restrictions, conventions, and exceptions specific
  to each target language, dialect, or framework.

## Scope

Apply only the section or sections that match the language, dialect, or
framework of the files being created, edited, reviewed, or refactored.

When a language, dialect, or framework section explicitly says it applies in
addition to a more general section, apply both sections. If those sections
overlap, prefer the more specific language, dialect, or framework rule.

If the target language, dialect, or framework has no section in this file, apply
only `CODING_RULES.md` plus repository conventions; do not invent unsupported
specific rules.

If a repository has stronger local conventions, follow the repository conventions first.

If a language-, dialect-, or framework-specific rule conflicts with a general
rule from `CODING_RULES.md`, the specific rule takes precedence.

Use the operational definitions in `CODING_RULES.md` for qualitative phrases such as `small` , `when practical` ,
`when possible` , and `when appropriate` .

## C

### Naming

- Match the existing C project naming style before applying generic C naming rules.
- If no project convention exists, use `lower_snake_case` for functions and variables, and `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for
  macros, enum constants, and project-wide constants.
- Avoid identifiers reserved by the selected C standard, the implementation, or the standard library; do not introduce
  names that start with reserved underscore patterns or collide with standard library identifiers.
- Use meaningful names that expose intent, role, and unit, such as `timeout_ms` instead of `timeout`.
- Name functions after the action they perform or the value they compute.
- Replace meaningful numeric literals with named constants, enum constants, or macros according to the project
  convention.

### Formatting

- Match the existing C project indentation, brace style, file organization, formatter configuration, and spacing before
  applying generic formatting preferences.
- Use `.c` files for implementation and `.h` files for shared declarations unless the project intentionally uses another
  C file layout.
- Keep C source files in a stable, readable order: standard and system includes, project includes, macros and constants,
  typedefs, enums, structs, globals, internal prototypes, then function implementations.
- Keep headers functionally scoped, expose only declarations needed by their module users, and protect each header
  against double inclusion with include guards.
- Include the matching public header from the source file that implements it so the compiler can detect declaration and
  definition mismatches.
- Use an automated formatter only when the project provides or requires one, and do not reformat unrelated C code.
- If no formatter exists, preserve local formatting and avoid mixed indentation, inconsistent spacing, and unrelated
  whitespace churn.
- Use braces consistently for `if` , `else` , `for` , `while` , and `do` bodies; when one branch needs braces, use
  braces for the related branches.

### Errors

- Check error returns from standard library calls, allocation calls, and platform APIs that report failure unless the
  project has a validated wrapper that handles failure centrally.
- Check `malloc` and `realloc` results before dereferencing the returned pointer or passing it to code that assumes
  success.
- When using `realloc` , keep the original pointer until the returned pointer has been checked so a failed resize does
  not lose the existing allocation.
- Include `errno` , `strerror` , or the relevant platform error detail in diagnostics when that information is
  available, meaningful, and safe to expose.
- Return a useful status, error code, or project-standard failure signal when a bounds check, allocation, file
  operation, or API call fails.
- Use assertions only for internal invariants, preconditions, postconditions, and impossible states; handle user input
  and runtime failures through the project's normal error path.
- Do not hide recoverable C errors behind silent fallbacks unless the fallback is explicitly safe and documented.

### Safety

- Do not change the configured C language standard silently; use the standard already selected by the build, CI, or
  project documentation.
- If no C standard is configured and syntax compatibility matters, state the assumption before selecting one.
- Do not use compiler-specific extensions, non-standard pragmas, implementation-specific attributes, or non-portable
  library calls unless they are required by the task and documented locally.
- When code must be portable across several C revisions, use only syntax and library facilities available in the oldest
  targeted standard.
- When targeting C89, C90, or C95, avoid later C conveniences unless the build explicitly permits them, including `//`
  comments, mixed declarations and statements, `inline` , variable length arrays, designated initializers, compound
  literals, `_Bool` , `restrict` , `<stdbool.h>` , and `<stdint.h>` .
- Do not define storage-owning global variables in headers; declare them with `extern` in a header and define them once
  in a source file only when global state is truly necessary.
- Mark file-local functions, objects, and private state as `static`.
- Mark pointer parameters as `const` when the pointed-to data is not modified.
- Pass destination capacity to every function that writes into caller-provided storage, and check the capacity before
  writing.
- Prefer enum constants for integral compile-time constants and `static const` objects for typed constants when
  preprocessing is not required.
- Use macros only for conditional compilation, compile-time substitution, or patterns that cannot be expressed cleanly
  with typed C constructs.
- Parenthesize macro parameters and expression bodies where applicable.
- Use `do { ... } while (0)` for multi-statement macros, and do not put a trailing semicolon inside the macro
  definition.
- Isolate platform and feature conditionals in localized compatibility headers or feature-level configuration macros
  when practical.
- Do not impose a universal `#if` versus `#ifdef` rule; follow the local project convention and avoid changing existing
  preprocessor style without explicit approval.

### Tests

- Define success criteria before editing C code.
- For a C bug fix, identify the failing behavior and the smallest verification command before modifying files.
- For new C behavior, identify the expected observable result before modifying files.
- After modifying C code, run the smallest relevant compilation, test, formatter, or static-analysis command available
  in the project.
- When the project declares a C standard, verify with the project's configured standard flags or build target instead of
  compiling under an unrelated dialect.
- If verification cannot be run, report exactly which C build, test, formatting, or static-analysis checks were not run
  and why.

### Idioms

- Prefer clarity, correctness, and maintainability over premature low-level optimization.
- Do not introduce low-level C optimizations unless the performance problem is explicit, measured, and documented.
- Keep functions focused on one reasonable unit of work.
- Split or rename functions when the code cannot be understood without excessive comments.
- Avoid duplicated C logic; extract a helper only when it has a clear purpose and does not add unnecessary abstraction.
- Order function parameters predictably: input parameters first, then output parameters.
- Use `goto` only for structured cleanup paths, with clear cleanup labels and no hidden control-flow surprises.
- Avoid assignments inside conditions; assign first, then test explicitly, unless the local project convention
  intentionally allows the idiom and the expression remains unambiguous.

### Other

- Make surgical C changes only; do not refactor adjacent code, normalize unrelated formatting, or replace project
  conventions unless the requested change requires it.
- Preserve surrounding C style, error-handling conventions, and module boundaries when modifying existing code.
- Document public C APIs and non-obvious functions so parameters, ownership expectations, return values, and failure
  modes are understandable.
- Comment intent, constraints, portability assumptions, ownership rules, and non-obvious decisions instead of restating
  obvious C syntax.
- Document deliberate hacks, portability workarounds, and performance deviations with the reason and the failure they
  avoid.
- Avoid redundant parameter comments that merely repeat the parameter name.

## C++

### Naming

- Match the existing C++ project naming style before applying generic C++ naming rules.
- Use names that expose intent, ownership, unit, lifetime, and thread-safety expectations when those details affect
  correct use.
- Prefer explicit, strongly typed interfaces over loosely typed parameters, hidden global state, namespace-scope mutable
  variables, or implicit side effects.
- Use raw pointers or references only for non-owning access, and use smart pointer types only when the interface must
  express ownership or lifetime semantics.

### Formatting

- Match the existing C++ project formatting, file layout, include organization, formatter configuration, and idioms
  before applying generic C++ preferences.
- Use only the C++ language and standard library features supported by the project's declared C++ standard, compiler
  versions, build flags, and platform constraints.
- Do not silently introduce newer C++ features, non-standard extensions, or vendor-specific behavior unless the project
  explicitly allows them.
- Declare variables as late as possible, in the smallest practical scope, and initialize them at declaration.
- Prefer initialization over later assignment, especially in constructors and complex control flow.
- Keep headers self-contained, guarded, and safe to include from more than one translation unit.
- Do not place non-inline object definitions or non-inline function definitions in headers when they would violate the
  one-definition rule.
- Do not place global `using namespace` directives in headers.
- Keep header include dependencies explicit and avoid cyclic dependencies.
- Use templates only when they reduce real duplication or express a real abstraction.
- Do not introduce templates for speculative flexibility.
- When using C++20 concepts, constrain template parameters with meaningful standard concepts where possible.
- For pre-C++20 code, document template requirements clearly and keep template interfaces minimal.

### Errors

- Follow one project-wide C++ error-handling policy consistently.
- Do not mix exceptions, error codes, assertions, status objects, and fail-fast behavior inconsistently inside the same
  C++ error boundary.
- If the project uses exceptions as its C++ error-handling policy, use them for failures that prevent a function from
  performing its assigned task.
- If the project disables exceptions, use a systematic alternative while still relying on RAII for cleanup.
- Use assertions only for internal invariants, preconditions, postconditions, and impossible states; handle ordinary
  runtime failures through the project's normal error path.
- Do not hide recoverable C++ errors behind silent fallbacks unless the fallback is explicitly safe and documented.

### Safety

- Use RAII objects to manage resource ownership instead of manual acquire/release pairs.
- Encapsulate files, locks, memory, sockets, handles, and other resources in objects whose destructors release them.
- Express ownership explicitly with values, references, raw pointers, `std::unique_ptr` , `std::shared_ptr` , or
  `std::weak_ptr` according to the required ownership semantics.
- Prefer `std::unique_ptr` for exclusive ownership.
- Use `std::shared_ptr` only when shared ownership is required.
- Prefer the rule of zero: design classes so compiler-generated special member functions are correct.
- If any special member function must be declared or deleted, review and explicitly define or delete the related
  destructor, copy, and move operations to avoid accidental ownership semantics.
- Always initialize objects before use.
- Use `const` or `constexpr` by default for values that should not change.
- Mark member functions `const` when they do not modify observable state.
- Pass cheap-to-copy values by value and expensive-to-copy input objects by `const` reference; use pointers only when
  identity, nullability, polymorphism, or lifetime semantics matter.
- Avoid shared mutable state by default.
- Treat global variables, static mutable locals, cached state, and shared references as potential data-race risks.
- Make thread-safety assumptions explicit in APIs or documentation when code can be used concurrently.
- Prefer `std::array` for fixed-size arrays and `std::vector` for variable-size sequences unless a stronger
  project-specific reason exists.
- Avoid owning raw arrays and manual `delete[]`.
- Use non-owning views such as spans only when they are available in the project C++ standard.
- Avoid C-style casts, unchecked raw arrays, function-like macros, constant macros, varargs, and representation-based
  type tricks in maintained C++ code.
- Do not use `memset` or `memcpy` on non-trivial C++ objects.
- Prefer typed C++ alternatives such as `constexpr` , inline functions, constructors, standard containers, and standard
  algorithms.

### Tests

- Define success criteria before editing C++ code.
- For a C++ bug fix, identify the failing behavior and the smallest verification command before modifying files.
- For new C++ behavior, identify the expected observable result before modifying files.
- After modifying C++ code, run the smallest relevant build, unit test, formatter, linter, static-analysis, sanitizer,
  or runtime check available in the project.
- When the project declares a C++ standard, verify with the project's configured standard flags or build target instead
  of compiling under an unrelated dialect.
- Keep successful C++ builds warning-free under the project's strict warning configuration.
- Understand each warning and fix the code rather than suppressing warnings without a documented justification.
- Prefer automated checks integrated into the build or CI so formatting, linting, static analysis, tests, and sanitizer
  regressions are caught early.
- If verification cannot be run, report exactly which C++ build, test, formatting, linting, static-analysis, sanitizer,
  or runtime checks were not run and why.

### Idioms

- Prefer clarity, correctness, and maintainability over premature optimization.
- Do not optimize C++ code speculatively or obscure intent for unmeasured performance assumptions.
- Measure bottlenecks before adding performance-oriented complexity.
- Keep functions focused on one clear logical operation.
- Split functions that mix unrelated responsibilities, hidden I/O, formatting, validation, state mutation, or business
  logic.
- Avoid duplicated C++ logic; extract a helper only when it has a clear purpose and does not add unnecessary
  abstraction.
- Prefer standard library containers, algorithms, and typed language facilities over lower-level C-style constructs.
- Preserve the project's established error-handling model, ownership idioms, naming, formatting, and file layout unless
  the user explicitly asks for a migration.

### Other

- Make surgical C++ changes only; do not refactor adjacent code, normalize unrelated formatting, or replace project
  conventions unless the requested change requires it.
- Comment intent, invariants, constraints, ownership, concurrency assumptions, and non-obvious tradeoffs instead of
  restating obvious C++ syntax.
- Update comments when code changes invalidate the intent or assumptions they describe.
- Apply Unreal Engine, CUDA, embedded, safety-critical, MISRA-like, organization-specific, or framework-specific C++
  rules only when the target code belongs to that ecosystem or the project explicitly requires them.
- Do not apply ecosystem-specific naming, exception, performance, memory, or safety policies to unrelated generic C++
  code.

## C\#

### Naming

- Match the existing C# project naming style before applying generic C# naming rules.
- Use `PascalCase` for public types, public members, namespaces, methods,
  properties, events, and enum values.
- Use `camelCase` for parameters and local variables.
- Prefix interface names with `I`.
- Name classes and structs with nouns or noun phrases.
- Name methods with verbs or verb phrases.
- Name properties with nouns, noun phrases, or adjectives.
- Name Boolean properties with affirmative names, optionally using `Is`, `Can`,
  or `Has` only when it improves readability.
- Use descriptive names and prefer readability over brevity.
- Avoid Hungarian notation, unclear abbreviations, contractions, and names that
  differ only by casing.

### Formatting

- Match the existing C# project formatting, file layout, namespace style,
  formatter configuration, and analyzer configuration before applying generic
  C# preferences.
- Use only the C# language features and .NET APIs supported by the project's
  declared target framework, language version, build configuration, and runtime
  constraints.
- Do not silently introduce newer C# syntax, framework-specific behavior, or
  runtime-specific APIs unless the project explicitly allows them.
- For new generic C# code without a local convention, use four spaces for
  indentation and do not use tab characters.
- Use one statement per line.
- Use one declaration per line.
- Use braces consistently for control-flow blocks.
- Keep `using` directives outside namespace declarations unless the repository
  style says otherwise.
- Prefer file-scoped namespaces for files that declare a single namespace when
  the target C# version supports them and the repository style accepts them.
- Use C# language keywords for built-in types in ordinary code, such as
  `string`, `int`, `bool`, and `object`, instead of `System.String`,
  `System.Int32`, `System.Boolean`, or `System.Object`.
- Place comments on their own line, start comment text with an uppercase letter,
  and end full-sentence comments with a period.
- Use XML documentation comments for public types and public members when
  documentation is required by the project or by the API contract.

### Errors

- Catch only exceptions that can be handled correctly at the current boundary.
- Avoid catching `Exception` broadly unless the code is at a controlled boundary
  and deliberately logs, rethrows, or translates the exception.
- Use specific exception types when they make diagnostics or caller handling more
  meaningful.
- Preserve the original stack trace by using `throw;` when rethrowing the current
  exception.
- Do not hide recoverable C# errors behind silent fallbacks unless the fallback
  is explicitly safe and documented.

### Safety

- Use `dynamic` only when runtime dispatch is intentionally required.
- Use `using` statements or `using` declarations for disposable resources.
- Implement the Dispose pattern only for types that own disposable or unmanaged
  resources.
- Avoid finalizers unless the type directly owns unmanaged resources that require
  finalization.
- Use `async` and `await` for I/O-bound operations when asynchronous APIs are
  available.
- Suffix asynchronous methods with `Async` unless the member is an event handler,
  override, interface implementation, or existing contract where the name is not
  freely controlled.
- Do not block asynchronous execution with `.Wait()`, `.Result`, or
  `Thread.Sleep`.
- Use `Task.Delay` instead of `Thread.Sleep` inside asynchronous flows.
- Accept and pass `CancellationToken` when asynchronous work may need
  cancellation.
- Do not use `Task.Run` as a generic wrapper to make synchronous I/O look
  asynchronous.
- Review shared mutable state for concurrency risks and protect it explicitly.
- Prefer properties over public fields for externally visible state.
- Keep fields as private as possible.
- Use properties for data-like access.
- Use methods for actions, computations, or operations with side effects.
- Do not make members public only to make unit testing easier.
- Do not expose mutable implementation details unless mutation is part of the
  intended contract.
- Replace repeated magic numbers and magic strings with named constants, enums,
  or configuration values.
- Explain non-obvious numeric values with a clear name or a short comment.
- Access static members through the declaring type, not through a derived type or
  an instance.

### Tests

- After modifying C# code, run the narrowest relevant build, test, formatter,
  analyzer, or inspection available in the project.
- When using version-dependent C# syntax or .NET APIs, verify them against the
  project's configured target framework, language version, and build target.
- Use `.editorconfig` to encode C# formatting and naming rules when maintaining
  project-wide C# style configuration.
- Enable .NET analyzers when practical and consistent with the project's
  existing tooling.
- Enforce C# style and analyzer rules in CI when the project already has a CI
  pipeline for those checks.
- Treat warnings as errors only when this matches the project's policy or when
  the repository explicitly opts into it.
- Do not change analyzer, formatter, or warning policies while editing unrelated
  C# code.
- If verification cannot be run, report exactly which C# build, test,
  formatting, analyzer, or inspection checks were not run and why.

### Idioms

- Use `int` by default for integer values unless the domain requires another
  numeric type.
- Use `var` only when the assigned type is obvious from the right side of the
  assignment.
- Do not use `var` when the type is hidden behind a method call or when explicit
  typing improves readability.
- Do not use variable names to encode the variable type.
- Use concise object creation when the target type is obvious and the target C#
  version supports it.
- Use object initializers when they make object construction clearer.
- Use collection expressions or concise collection initialization when supported
  by the target C# version and accepted by the repository style.
- Use `required` properties or `init` properties only when the project's target
  C# version supports them and they clarify mandatory initialization.
- Use string interpolation for short string composition.
- Use `StringBuilder` when appending strings repeatedly in loops or when
  building large text.
- Prefer raw string literals when they reduce escaping and improve readability.
- Use LINQ when it improves readability.
- Do not replace a simple readable loop with LINQ when LINQ makes the code
  harder to read or worse for performance.
- Use meaningful LINQ query variable names.
- Use aliases for anonymous type properties when names would otherwise be
  ambiguous.
- Apply `where` clauses before later LINQ clauses when doing so reduces the data
  processed by subsequent clauses and preserves query semantics.
- Be careful not to change query execution semantics accidentally, especially
  when moving between `IQueryable<T>` and `IEnumerable<T>`.

### Other

- Apply this section to general C# and .NET code unless the repository already
  defines a stricter local style guide, `.editorconfig`, analyzer configuration,
  or framework-specific convention.
- Do not generalize ASP.NET Core, Unity, or library-design-specific guidance to
  all C# code unless the current codebase actually targets that ecosystem.
- Prefer official Microsoft C# and .NET guidance over third-party style guides
  when sources conflict.
- Make surgical C# changes only; do not reformat unrelated code.
- Do not refactor adjacent C# code unless the task explicitly requires it.
- Match existing repository style even when a generic C# rule would be different.
- Remove only unused imports, variables, or helpers made unused by the current
  C# change.

## HTML

### Naming

- Use semantic `class` and `id` names that describe the content, role, or domain concept instead of visual appearance
  alone.
- Prefer kebab-case for multi-word `class` and `id` values unless the repository already defines a stricter naming
  convention.
- Give links, buttons, form controls, headings, and page titles meaningful text that remains understandable outside its
  visual context.

### Formatting

- Start every standalone HTML document with `<!doctype html>` to trigger standards or no-quirks rendering mode.
- Do not use legacy HTML doctypes or XML declarations for normal HTML documents.
- Add a valid `lang` attribute to the root `<html>` element, using the shortest accurate language value for the page
  content.
- Include a meaningful `<title>` element in every standalone HTML document; the title must describe the page purpose,
  not only the project or application name.
- Keep metadata, page title, linked resources, and document-level configuration inside `<head>` , and keep visible
  content inside `<body>` .
- Use lowercase for doctype declarations, element names, attribute names, and case-insensitive attribute values.
- Quote attribute values consistently, and never omit quotes when the value contains spaces or could be parsed as
  multiple attributes.
- For boolean attributes, write only the attribute name when the value is true.
- Escape reserved characters such as `&` , `<` , `>` , `"` , and `'` when they would otherwise be parsed as markup or
  attribute syntax.
- Keep attribute lists readable and consistent; avoid arbitrary spacing, mixed quotation styles, and mixed casing within
  the same document or project.
- Structure text with headings, paragraphs, lists, and other content elements instead of using line breaks or visual
  styling to simulate document structure.
- Use heading levels to represent the document outline, not merely to control visual size.

### Errors

- Treat missing required document structure, such as `<!doctype html>` , `<html lang>` , `<head>` , `<title>` , or
  `<body>` in standalone documents, as a defect to fix before finalizing generated HTML.
- Treat unlabeled interactive controls, missing form instructions, unclear error messages, and inaccessible validation
  feedback as defects.
- When automatically detected input errors can occur, identify the invalid input and describe the error in text.
- Treat malformed attribute syntax, unescaped reserved characters, invalid nesting, and duplicate IDs as defects to fix
  before presenting HTML as final.

### Safety

- Prefer native HTML semantics over redundant ARIA; do not add roles that duplicate implicit semantics unless there is a
  specific compatibility reason.
- Use native interactive elements such as `<button>` , `<a>` , `<input>` , `<select>` , and `<textarea>` instead of
  custom clickable `<div>` or `<span>` elements whenever they match the required behavior.
- Ensure interactive functionality is keyboard-operable unless the function inherently depends on pointer movement.
- Add useful `alt` text to informative images, and use empty `alt` text only for decorative images that should be
  ignored by assistive technologies.
- For data tables, use `<th>` for headers and add `scope` when it is needed to associate headers with rows or columns.
- Add `<caption>` to data tables when a concise summary helps users understand the table.
- Provide labels or instructions for form controls that require user input.
- Use HTML attributes that expose input purpose when collecting user information and when the expected meaning can be
  programmatically determined.
- Do not use color as the only way to convey information, indicate an action, request a response, or distinguish an
  element.
- Warn users when a link opens a new window, opens a new tab, or points to a non-HTML resource, using visible text or an
  accessible equivalent.
- Provide a skip link near the start of `<body>` when pages contain repeated navigation before the main content.
- Do not convert accessible native HTML into custom markup unless the user explicitly requests a custom component and
  the accessibility behavior is reimplemented.

### Tests

- Before finalizing generated HTML, verify that every element has a clear structural or semantic purpose.
- Before finalizing generated HTML, verify that generated interactive controls are keyboard-accessible, labeled, and
  understandable without visual context.
- Validate standalone HTML for document structure, malformed markup, duplicate IDs, invalid nesting, and unescaped
  reserved characters when a validator or equivalent project check is available.
- Review images, tables, forms, headings, links, buttons, source order, and repeated navigation for accessibility
  regressions.
- When modifying existing HTML, verify that the change preserves the project's established formatting and naming
  conventions unless they conflict with accessibility, validity, or explicit user requirements.

### Idioms

- Use the correct HTML element for the intended meaning before considering generic `<div>` or `<span>` markup.
- Use semantic layout elements such as `<header>` , `<nav>` , `<main>` , `<article>` , `<aside>` , and `<footer>` when
  their meaning matches the content.
- Preserve a logical source order; do not rely on CSS layout to compensate for an HTML order that becomes confusing when
  read by assistive technologies.
- Generate the simplest valid HTML that satisfies the requested structure.
- Do not add speculative components, styling hooks, ARIA roles, scripts, or metadata that the user did not request.

### Other

- Avoid using `data-*` attributes when a standard semantic element or attribute already represents the same information.
- Use `data-*` only for application-specific metadata that has no suitable native HTML representation.
- Avoid `<base>` unless the project explicitly requires it; prefer explicit, stable paths for links and resources to
  reduce maintenance surprises.
- Add resource `type` metadata when it clarifies non-obvious linked resources, such as alternate feeds or downloadable
  documents.
- In HTML templating environments, separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into maintainable units when the platform supports
  includes or equivalent composition.
- Treat HTML templating organization as a project organization concern, not as a universal HTML syntax requirement.

## CSS

### Naming

- Use the project's existing CSS naming convention before introducing a new one.
- If no project convention exists, use lowercase kebab-case for class names, custom properties, animation names, and
  other custom identifiers.
- Use semantic class names that describe the component, role, state, or domain concept instead of visual appearance
  alone.
- Avoid styling against generated, random, or framework-internal class names; use stable project-owned classes,
  attributes, or framework-supported hooks when a selector must outlive a render cycle.
- Use CSS custom properties for repeated declaration values such as colors, spacing, font sizes, shadows, durations,
  z-indexes, and component-local measurements when reuse, theming, or safer maintenance is needed. Do not use `var()` in
  media or container query conditions unless the project's build tooling explicitly supports that pattern.

### Formatting

- Match the existing project formatting, ordering, import structure, and organization before applying any generic CSS
  convention.
- Use the project-configured formatter or linter when one exists, and do not introduce new CSS tooling unless the task
  explicitly allows tooling changes.
- Organize styles into clear logical sections such as base styles, typography, layout, components, utilities, and
  overrides when the file size or project style justifies it.
- Add section comments only when they help navigation; do not comment obvious declarations.
- Keep related declarations together inside a rule, such as layout, box model, typography, color, and effects.
- Put custom properties near the top of a declaration block when they are local to that rule.
- Use shorthand properties only when every constituent value is intentional and the shorthand improves readability.
- Do not mix shorthand and longhand properties for the same concern when that creates hidden overrides.
- Preserve a predictable CSS import order when cascade order affects behavior; do not auto-sort CSS imports blindly.
- Keep CSS code blocks syntactically valid and parseable; do not place pseudo-syntax, informal grammar, or invalid
  placeholders inside `css` fenced blocks.

### Errors

- Treat invalid CSS syntax, malformed selectors, unmatched braces, empty declaration blocks, and non-functional
  declarations as defects to fix before finalizing CSS.
- Treat accidental duplicate declarations, repeated selectors, contradictory rules, and dead CSS as defects when they
  are introduced or exposed by the current change.
- Do not use `!important` to escape ordinary specificity or cascade problems; first refactor selector specificity,
  cascade order, or component structure.
- Use `!important` only when there is a documented and unavoidable reason, such as overriding a third-party rule that
  cannot be changed.
- Do not use arbitrary hard-coded values only because they visually work; replace them with named tokens, relative
  units, or layout mechanisms when practical.
- Add a short comment for unusual values when the reason cannot be expressed through naming, tokens, or structure.

### Safety

- Prefer class selectors for styling because they are reusable and keep specificity manageable.
- Avoid ID selectors for styling unless a specific, documented constraint requires them.
- Keep selectors as simple as possible while still targeting the intended elements.
- Avoid deeply nested, overly broad, or unnecessarily qualified selectors when a clear class selector is sufficient.
- Use standard modern CSS only when it is supported by the project's declared browser baseline.
- Avoid deprecated, obsolete, non-standard, or unnecessary vendor-prefixed features unless a compatibility fallback is
  explicitly required.
- Do not place reusable styling in HTML `style` attributes; use CSS files, scoped CSS, components, or existing utility
  classes instead.
- Use inline styles only for dynamic runtime values that cannot be represented cleanly elsewhere, and make that
  exception explicit.
- Do not introduce Sass, Less, BEM, SMACSS, utility-first CSS, CSS Modules, or another methodology unless the project
  already uses it or the user explicitly requests it.
- When a framework supports scoped component styles, use scoped styles for component-specific CSS and reserve global CSS
  for true global concerns.

### Tests

- Before finalizing CSS, verify that generated or modified styles follow the existing project convention.
- Verify that selectors are no more specific than necessary and that no unnecessary `!important` declaration was added.
- Verify that no dead, duplicated, empty, or contradictory CSS remains in the touched scope.
- Verify that CSS import order has not been changed in a way that unintentionally affects cascade behavior.
- Verify responsive behavior for the affected layout ranges when CSS changes media queries, container queries, layout,
  sizing, or visibility.
- Run the project's CSS formatter, linter, build, visual regression checks, or browser checks when they are available
  and relevant to the change.
- When framework-specific CSS rules are applied, verify that the target framework or styling system is actually in use.

### Idioms

- Use the simplest CSS layout model that fits the requirement.
- Prefer Flexbox and CSS Grid for modern layout instead of float-based or table-based layout hacks.
- Write responsive CSS intentionally, using the project's established approach such as mobile-first styling when
  applicable.
- Keep media queries and container queries scoped to real layout changes instead of arbitrary visual patching.
- Plan broad or complex CSS before writing it by identifying base styles, layout styles, component styles, overrides,
  and reusable patterns.
- Avoid CSS that repeatedly overrides or cancels earlier declarations.
- If the project uses Tailwind or another utility-first system, prefer existing utilities before writing ad-hoc CSS.
- Do not mix utility-first styling and custom CSS in a way that duplicates the same styling responsibility.

### Other

- Prefer project-specific CSS standards first.
- If the project has no CSS convention, apply the smallest consistent rule set needed to keep stylesheets readable,
  testable, and maintainable.
- Prefer official, maintained, and directly applicable CSS documentation over generic blog posts, forums, social media
  discussions, or video content.
- Apply framework-specific CSS guidance only when the project context confirms that the framework is in use.
- When modifying existing CSS, change only the rules required by the requested behavior and avoid unrelated selector,
  naming, or file-organization refactors.

## SQL

### Naming

- Use descriptive and stable names for tables, columns, CTEs, views, and aliases.
- Prefer identifiers that describe the business meaning of the data rather than implementation details.
- Avoid vague names, unexplained abbreviations, Hungarian prefixes such as `tbl_` , and identifiers that collide with
  reserved SQL keywords.
- When a query references multiple tables, assign meaningful aliases and qualify selected columns with those aliases.
- Do not rely on unqualified column names in joins, because they can become ambiguous or break when schemas evolve.

### Formatting

- Write SQL so that another engineer can understand the intent without reconstructing hidden assumptions.
- Prefer explicit, readable SQL over clever or overly compact SQL.
- Use one formatting convention consistently across the repository.
- If no repository convention exists, use uppercase SQL keywords, lowercase `snake_case` identifiers, consistent
  indentation, and one logical expression per line for complex queries.
- Do not mix casing, alias styles, indentation styles, or comma conventions inside the same file.
- Use explicit `JOIN ... ON` clauses instead of implicit joins in the `WHERE` clause.
- Keep join predicates in `ON` clauses and filtering predicates in `WHERE` clauses, unless a specific outer-join
  semantic requires otherwise.
- Do not use `SELECT *` in production SQL that returns a result set; explicitly list the columns required by the caller,
  report, migration, or validation step.
- Use `SELECT *` only for exploration, and only with an explicit row limit.
- Inside `EXISTS` , prefer a constant projection such as `SELECT 1` unless the project or target database has a
  documented convention.
- Add comments when they explain business rules, non-obvious filters, data-quality workarounds, performance tradeoffs,
  or intentional deviations from normal conventions.
- Do not comment syntax that the SQL already expresses plainly.
- Keep SQL comments current when query logic changes.

### Errors

- Handle `NULL` explicitly with `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL`, and `COALESCE` where appropriate.
- Do not compare nullable values as if `NULL` were an ordinary value.
- Keep nullable logic visible instead of hiding it inside unclear expressions.
- In grouped queries, include every non-aggregated selected column in the `GROUP BY` clause unless the target database
  provides a documented and intentional functional-dependency rule.
- Do not rely on permissive database behavior that returns arbitrary non-grouped values.
- Do not add `DISTINCT` merely to remove unexpected duplicates.
- Investigate and fix the join condition, grouping level, or source data issue when duplicates are unexpected.

### Safety

- Use query parameters for user-controlled values.
- Do not construct SQL by concatenating raw user input.
- Use primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, `NOT NULL` , and `CHECK` constraints when they express durable
  data integrity rules.
- Do not leave critical integrity rules only in application code when the database can enforce them reliably.
- Choose SQL data types that match the domain.
- Avoid floating-point types for exact financial values; use exact numeric types such as `NUMERIC` or `DECIMAL` when
  precision matters.
- Wrap related changes in a transaction when they must succeed or fail together.
- Keep transactions as short as possible.
- Do not wait for user interaction while a transaction is open.

### Tests

- Run `sqlfluff lint` against generated or modified SQL scripts when SQLFluff is installed, available, accessible, and
  suitable for the target SQL dialect.
- Use the repository's existing SQLFluff configuration and dialect settings when they exist.
- If `sqlfluff lint` requires a dialect and no reliable project or task context identifies one, report the limitation
  instead of guessing a dialect silently.
- Treat `sqlfluff lint` syntax failures as blocking defects. Treat SQLFluff style and lint findings as defects unless
  they conflict with a verified project convention or an explicitly documented target-database requirement.
- Do not disable, relax, or bypass SQLFluff rules to make SQL pass unless the user explicitly requests that
  configuration change.
- If SQLFluff is not installed, unavailable, inaccessible, or unsuitable for the target dialect, report that limitation
  and use the best available fallback check, such as the target database parser, a migration dry run, `EXPLAIN`, the
  project's SQL test command, dbt compilation, or a dialect-aware manual review.
- State that fallback validation does not replace a successful `sqlfluff lint` run.
- Do not treat SQLFluff as a substitute for semantic, migration, schema, permission, or performance validation; use it
  together with the relevant database, migration, test, and execution-plan checks when correctness depends on runtime
  behavior.
- For slow, expensive, business-critical, or production-impacting SQL, inspect the execution plan instead of guessing.
- Verify whether performance-sensitive queries scan too much data, use expected indexes, sort unnecessarily, or perform
  expensive joins.
- When result order matters to a caller, report, export, pagination workflow, or deterministic test, make that order
  explicit with `ORDER BY` .
- Do not add `ORDER BY` when result order is irrelevant.
- Validate schema changes against the intended primary keys, foreign keys, uniqueness, nullability, check constraints,
  data types, indexes, and transaction behavior.

### Idioms

- Apply selective filters as early as possible when doing so preserves query semantics, especially before aggregation,
  joins, CTE reuse, or subquery processing.
- Do not move filters across outer joins, aggregations, or window calculations unless the result set remains
  intentionally unchanged.
- Use `WHERE` for row-level filters and reserve `HAVING` for aggregate filters.
- Keep predicates index-friendly by avoiding functions, arithmetic, concatenation, or `CASE` expressions around indexed
  columns in `WHERE` predicates when an equivalent direct predicate is possible.
- Prefer range predicates and explicit Boolean logic that allow the optimizer to use indexes.
- Use `=` for exact matches and reserve `LIKE` for pattern matching.
- Avoid leading wildcards such as `LIKE '%term'` or `LIKE '%term%'` unless the performance cost is acceptable and
  documented.
- Use `EXISTS` instead of `COUNT(*)` when the requirement is only to check whether at least one matching row exists.
- Use `UNION ALL` when duplicates are acceptable or already impossible.
- Use `UNION` only when deduplication is required and the cost is justified.
- Use CTEs when they make a query easier to read, test, or reuse.
- Do not introduce CTEs for trivial single-use logic if they make the query longer without clarifying intent.
- Add indexes only for known access patterns, filter predicates, joins, ordering needs, or uniqueness constraints.
- Do not add indexes without considering write cost, storage cost, and workload tradeoffs.

### Other

- Prefer standard SQL when portability matters.
- Use vendor-specific functions, hints, syntax, or extensions only when they are required, documented, and isolated
  enough to be changed later.
- Treat SQL as code and store DDL, DML, migrations, seed scripts, and repeatable maintenance scripts in version control.
- Do not rely on undocumented manual production changes.

## MySQL

Apply this section to MySQL code in addition to the generic `SQL` section. When
both sections address the same topic, prefer the more specific MySQL rule.

### Naming

- Use clear, stable, and project-consistent names for MySQL databases, tables,
  columns, indexes, constraints, routines, triggers, and aliases.
- Define an explicit primary key for every table, using a stable natural key only
  when it is obvious and using an auto-incrementing surrogate key when no
  natural key is clear.
- Match foreign key column data types and MySQL-required attributes with the
  referenced columns: fixed-precision size and sign must match, and nonbinary
  string columns must use the same character set and collation.
- Name foreign key columns consistently with the referenced domain concept so
  join intent remains easy to review.
- Do not encode multiple logical values in a single column when those values
  need to be queried, indexed, constrained, or updated independently.
- Document the purpose of non-obvious indexes, especially composite, prefix,
  covering, or workload-specific indexes.

### Formatting

- Keep MySQL DDL, DML, migration scripts, and maintenance SQL readable enough
  that storage engine choices, transaction boundaries, locking behavior, and
  operational assumptions are visible to a reviewer.
- Prefer explicit column lists in production MySQL queries and return only the
  rows and columns required by the caller, report, migration, or validation
  step.
- Use deterministic `ORDER BY` clauses for pagination and for any query where
  result order matters.
- Keep predicates sargable by avoiding unnecessary functions, casts, arithmetic,
  implicit conversions, or incompatible type comparisons on indexed columns.
- Keep related transaction statements close together and make `START
  TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` boundaries explicit.

### Errors

- Handle MySQL deadlocks and lock wait timeouts at the application boundary with
  bounded retries only when the operation is idempotent or safely repeatable.
- Define rollback behavior before adding multi-step writes, production
  migrations, or destructive schema changes.

### Safety

- Use `InnoDB` as the default storage engine for transactional application data
  unless a documented requirement justifies another engine.
- Require `NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION` in controlled environments where accidental
  storage engine substitution would create operational risk.
- Use MySQL foreign keys when the application domain requires referential
  integrity to be enforced by the database.
- Add or change indexes only when justified by an observed query pattern, an
  `EXPLAIN` plan, or a documented performance reason.
- Design composite indexes according to MySQL's leftmost-prefix rule.
- Avoid redundant indexes that serve the same prefix and access pattern as an
  existing index.
- Evaluate storage cost and write overhead before adding indexes to high-write
  MySQL tables.
- Analyze non-trivial `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `INSERT ... SELECT`, and
  `REPLACE` statements with `EXPLAIN` before optimizing or approving them.
- Avoid unbounded reads in application endpoints and batch large reads or writes
  when practical.
- Keep MySQL transactions short, explicit, and limited to one business
  operation.
- Do not mix unrelated business operations in the same MySQL transaction.
- Do not use `LOCK TABLES` for normal InnoDB application workflows.
- Use row-level locking patterns such as `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` only when
  exclusive access to specific rows is required.
- Do not create long-running transactions for batch jobs without chunking,
  progress tracking, and rollback strategy.
- Use dedicated MySQL users per application, service, or job.
- Do not use `root` or broad administrative accounts for application runtime
  access.
- Grant the minimum required privileges at the narrowest practical scope:
  database, table, column, or routine.
- Require prepared statements or parameterized query APIs for
  application-provided values.
- Require TLS for sensitive database connections and avoid plaintext credentials
  or data in transit.
- Avoid exposing MySQL directly to the public internet unless an explicit,
  reviewed operational requirement exists.
- Prefer private networking for MySQL access when possible.
- Never allow unrestricted `0.0.0.0/0` database access without an explicitly
  documented temporary exception.
- Treat `SECURITY DEFINER`, stored routines, dynamic SQL, triggers, and elevated
  privileges as high-risk areas requiring explicit review.
- Do not store MySQL credentials in source code, committed configuration files,
  or logs.
- Avoid destructive schema changes without an explicit backup, rollback, or data
  recovery strategy.

### Deployment and Operations

Apply this section only when creating, editing, reviewing, or refactoring MySQL
deployment, runtime configuration, migrations, backups, or maintenance scripts.
For ordinary query, schema, or application SQL changes, do not expand the task
into operational changes unless the current change directly affects them.

- Configure database connection timeouts explicitly instead of relying on
  unknown client, driver, or server defaults.
- Use exponential backoff for transient connection failures, maintenance events,
  and failover recovery.
- Split large schema or data migrations into ordered, observable, and restartable
  steps.
- Ensure failed migrations, interrupted batch jobs, and partially applied data
  changes have a documented recovery path.
- Do not treat a backup, export, or point-in-time recovery setup as valid until
  restore behavior has been tested.
- Rotate credentials and remove unused MySQL users during regular maintenance
  reviews.
- Verify that production backups, retention, binary log retention, recovery
  point objective, and recovery time objective match project recovery
  requirements.
- Protect MySQL backups from accidental deletion and unauthorized access.
- Monitor CPU, memory, disk, connections, slow queries, replication, and
  failover health for production MySQL systems.
- Add alerting for disk space thresholds and avoid running near full storage.
- Tune MySQL server parameters only with a documented hypothesis, before-and-
  after measurements, and a rollback plan.
- Test major MySQL upgrades in a representative environment before production.
- Run MySQL upgrade checks and fix incompatibilities before the production
  upgrade.
- Verify that a full backup exists and is restorable before upgrading
  production.
- Benchmark critical queries before and after MySQL upgrades because optimizer,
  authentication, encryption, storage engine, index, and memory changes can
  introduce regressions.
- Test application behavior during MySQL maintenance and failover events because
  existing connections can be dropped.
- Use slow query logs, query insights, or equivalent tooling to identify real
  bottlenecks before changing schema, indexes, or server configuration.
- Review slow queries periodically and prioritize fixes by frequency, latency,
  and business impact.
- Use connection pooling for applications that open many short-lived MySQL
  connections.
- Set a clear upper bound for connection pools per application instance and
  account for horizontal scaling.
- Close or return MySQL connections to the pool promptly after each unit of
  work.
- Use exports only as an additional protection mechanism when backup scope or
  retention does not cover the recovery scenario.

### Tests

- Use the same SQL mode for export and import migrations when moving data
  between MySQL environments.
- Test schema migrations in an environment that represents production data
  volume, indexes, constraints, storage engine, character sets, collations, and
  SQL mode.
- Capture baseline metrics before performance changes and compare them after the
  change.

### Idioms

- Use joins for relational access instead of repeated application-side lookups
  when related data can be retrieved in one controlled MySQL query.
- Use explicit `START TRANSACTION` and `COMMIT` blocks for related DML
  operations that must succeed or fail together.
- Prefer covering indexes only for hot read paths where selected columns are
  stable and the query benefit outweighs maintenance overhead.
- Prefer clear MySQL over clever MySQL unless the optimized form is measurably
  better and remains maintainable.

### Other

- Prefer official MySQL documentation and maintained managed-provider
  documentation when MySQL guidance conflicts.
- Do not generate MySQL-specific rules for another SQL dialect without explicit
  compatibility validation.
- Do not assume cloud-provider recommendations apply unchanged to self-managed
  MySQL.
- Do not assume self-managed MySQL settings apply unchanged to managed MySQL
  services.
- Keep MySQL rules separate from ORM-specific, framework-specific, and
  cloud-provider-specific rules unless the target context explicitly requires
  them.
- Document assumptions about MySQL version, deployment model, storage engine,
  SQL mode, character set, collation, and client driver when they affect a
  recommendation.
- Do not introduce a new index, transaction boundary, privilege, trigger, stored
  procedure, routine, server parameter, or migration behavior without explaining
  the operational impact.
- When modifying MySQL, always check regression risk in result cardinality,
  locking behavior, transaction scope, index usage, privilege requirements,
  migration compatibility, and deployment model compatibility.

## Oracle PL/SQL

Apply this section to Oracle PL/SQL code in addition to the generic `SQL`
section. When both sections address the same topic, prefer the more specific
Oracle PL/SQL rule.

### Naming

- Use project-defined naming conventions consistently for packages, procedures,
  functions, parameters, variables, constants, and exceptions.
- When a repository defines PL/SQL prefixes such as `p_`, `l_`, `g_`, `lc_`, or
  `gc_`, apply them consistently inside the touched PL/SQL scope.
- Name functions after the value they return and procedures after the action
  they perform.
- Use `%TYPE` and `%ROWTYPE` for variables, records, rows, and cursor results
  that are tied to database columns or query results.
- Do not hard-code PL/SQL data types when the variable represents an existing
  table column, row, cursor row, or schema-owned type.
- Replace magic values with named constants, domain concepts, lookup functions,
  or package-level APIs when they represent statuses, thresholds, business
  rules, or domain values.

### Formatting

- Keep package specifications focused on the public API and keep implementation
  details in the package body.
- Do not change a package specification unless the public API must change.
- Prefer implementation changes in package bodies when the public contract does
  not need to change.
- Keep executable sections short enough that the main control flow remains easy
  to review.
- Extract named local procedures or functions when a PL/SQL block grows into
  multiple logical steps.
- Use `ELSIF` or `CASE` for mutually exclusive branches instead of independent
  `IF` blocks.
- Do not generate `GOTO` in PL/SQL code; use structured conditionals, loops,
  local subprograms, or explicit error handling instead.

### Errors

- Centralize reusable PL/SQL error handling in package APIs instead of
  duplicating exception logging logic in every handler.
- Catch specific exceptions before using `WHEN OTHERS`.
- Use `WHEN OTHERS` only at an outer boundary where the error can be logged,
  preserved, and deliberately re-raised or translated.
- Do not hide the root cause of an exception.
- Do not use exceptions as normal branching logic.
- Keep transaction control out of reusable PL/SQL components by default.
- Do not issue `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` inside reusable packages, procedures, or
  functions unless that component explicitly owns the transaction boundary.
- Use autonomous transactions only for isolated logging or audit records that
  must survive rollback of the main transaction.

### Safety

- Do not expose mutable package state in the package specification.
- Declare non-constant package-level data in the package body, and expose access
  through explicit getter or setter subprograms only when needed.
- Keep functions value-oriented and side-effect-light.
- Do not use `OUT` or `IN OUT` parameters in functions.
- Use procedures when logic performs DML, modifies state, or must return
  multiple outputs.
- Use `NOCOPY` only when large `OUT` or `IN OUT` parameters are necessary and
  safe after checking exception and aliasing risks.
- Use bind variables whenever runtime values are passed into SQL.
- Do not concatenate runtime values into SQL text when bind variables can be
  used.
- Prefer static SQL when dynamic SQL is not required.
- Validate identifiers, values, and allowed operations explicitly before using
  them in dynamic SQL.
- Choose invoker-rights or definer-rights deliberately for PL/SQL units.
- Do not rely on the default privilege model without checking the security
  impact.
- Apply least privilege to PL/SQL APIs and underlying schema objects.
- Prefer granting access through narrow package APIs instead of broad direct
  privileges on tables, views, or critical procedures.

### Tests

- Write regression tests before changing legacy PL/SQL behavior.
- Write unit tests for packages, procedures, and functions when their behavior
  must not regress.
- Keep each PL/SQL unit test focused on one behavior.
- Use an Arrange-Act-Assert structure for PL/SQL tests: set up inputs and
  database state, execute the PL/SQL unit, then assert the expected result.
- Design tests so that an incorrect implementation can actually fail the test.
- Rerun affected PL/SQL tests after code, data, package specification, package
  body, or schema changes.
- Use available PL/SQL checks and tools such as compiler warnings, PL/Scope,
  the PL/SQL hierarchical profiler, SQL Developer, Toad, or SonarQube when they
  are part of the project toolchain.

### Idioms

- Implement reusable PL/SQL logic inside packages by default.
- Avoid standalone procedures or functions unless the target environment or
  integration point explicitly requires them.
- Treat the package specification as the public API and the package body as the
  private implementation.
- Encapsulate business rules and repeated SQL behind package functions or
  procedures.
- Do not duplicate business logic, predicates, formulas, or SQL fragments across
  pages, triggers, procedures, or anonymous blocks.
- Prefer set-based SQL and bulk processing over row-by-row processing.
- Use `BULK COLLECT` and `FORALL` for high-volume operations when they reduce
  context switches and fit the available memory constraints.
- Minimize work inside loops by avoiding repeated calculations and unnecessary
  repeated passes over collections or result sets.
- Use cursor `FOR` loops only when every row must be processed.
- Do not use cursor `FOR` loops for single-row retrieval.
- When fetching from explicit cursors, fetch into records rather than unrelated
  individual variables.
- Do not declare the index variable of a numeric `FOR` loop; let PL/SQL define
  it implicitly.
- Use Oracle built-ins, SQL functions, PL/SQL built-ins, and Oracle-supplied
  packages before writing custom implementations.
- Use early `EXIT`, `EXIT WHEN`, or `RETURN` from `FOR` and `WHILE` loops only
  when the exit condition is intentional and clearer than carrying extra state
  or nesting conditionals.
- For searched `CASE` expressions with overlapping predicates, preserve
  semantic correctness before optimizing branch order.
- Reorder searched `CASE` branches for performance only when the predicates
  remain semantically equivalent.

### Other

- Document public package APIs in the package specification.
- Public package API documentation should explain the purpose, parameters, and
  return values of exposed procedures and functions.
- Avoid documenting obvious implementation details that are already clear from
  the PL/SQL code itself.

## Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL

Apply this section to Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL code in addition to the generic `SQL` section when the target
language or database dialect is T-SQL. When both sections address the same topic, prefer the more specific T-SQL rule.

### Naming

- Before generating T-SQL, identify the exact target platform: SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed
  Instance, Azure Synapse Analytics, Fabric SQL, or another Microsoft SQL platform.
- Do not assume that every T-SQL feature is available on every Microsoft SQL platform.
- State the target SQL Server product, deployment model, and version when syntax, behavior, compatibility level, or
  feature availability matters.
- Use schema-qualified object names such as `dbo.customer` whenever possible.
- Do not rely on the caller's default schema for production database objects.
- Do not use the `sp_` prefix for user-defined stored procedures.
- Use stable, descriptive object, procedure, parameter, variable, temporary table, and alias names.
- Follow the repository convention for identifier casing; if no local convention exists, keep T-SQL keywords uppercase
  and identifiers consistently cased.
- Prefix Unicode string literals with `N`, such as `N'value'`, when the literal contains or may contain Unicode text.

### Formatting

- Terminate T-SQL statements with semicolons consistently.
- Always terminate `MERGE` statements with a semicolon.
- Write T-SQL so that the target platform, object names, filtering logic, ordering logic, and transaction boundaries are
  visible to a reviewer.
- Use explicit column lists in production `SELECT` statements instead of `SELECT *`.
- Return only the rows and columns required by the caller, report, export, validation, or data-change operation.
- Use `ORDER BY` whenever result order matters.
- Do not rely on storage order, clustered index order, insertion order, or execution-plan side effects for result
  ordering.
- Do not use ordinal positions such as `ORDER BY 1` or `ORDER BY 2`; use explicit column names or aliases.
- Use `TOP (...)` with parentheses.
- Pair `TOP (...)` with `ORDER BY` when deterministic row selection is required.
- Use `OFFSET` and `FETCH` for page-based retrieval when they are supported by the target platform and version.
- For stable paging, use a deterministic and preferably unique ordering key.
- Use named parameters when executing stored procedures, such as `EXEC dbo.MyProcedure @UserId = @user_id;`.
- Put `SET NOCOUNT ON;` at the start of stored procedures unless the caller intentionally depends on row-count messages.
- Declare procedure-sensitive `SET` options explicitly at the start of the procedure when the logic depends on them.
- Explicitly define `NULL` or `NOT NULL` for temporary table columns instead of relying on session defaults.
- Keep T-SQL hints, session options, transaction settings, and version-specific syntax local to the statement,
  procedure, or migration that requires them.

### Errors

- Use `TRY...CATCH` for transactional, procedural, or multi-step T-SQL logic that needs controlled error handling.
- Do not assume `TRY...CATCH` catches compile-level, connection-level, or every possible severity-level failure.
- In `CATCH` blocks, deliberately return, rethrow, or translate errors when caller visibility is required.
- Prefer `THROW` over `RAISERROR` in new T-SQL code when rethrowing or raising procedural errors.
- Use `XACT_STATE()` in `CATCH` blocks before deciding whether to commit or roll back a transaction.
- Roll back uncommittable transactions instead of attempting to commit them.
- Use `SET XACT_ABORT ON;` when a runtime error must terminate and roll back the full transaction.
- Keep transactions as short as possible to reduce locking, blocking, and deadlock risk.
- Do not wait for user interaction, external approval, or long-running non-database work while a transaction is open.
- When generated T-SQL can fail because of missing objects, permissions, invalid input, duplicate data, or unexpected
  cardinality, make the failure path explicit.

### Safety

- Never concatenate unvalidated user input into dynamic SQL.
- Validate input type, length, format, range, and allowed values before using external input in T-SQL.
- Parameterize dynamic SQL with `sp_executesql` whenever dynamic SQL is required and values can be parameterized.
- Review any generated use of `EXEC`, `EXECUTE`, or `sp_executesql` as a SQL injection risk boundary.
- Use `QUOTENAME()` for dynamic identifiers when identifier generation is unavoidable and the input length is suitable.
- Use quote-doubling with `REPLACE()` for dynamic string literals when dynamic SQL cannot be avoided.
- Do not use dynamic SQL for static statements that can be written safely as ordinary parameterized T-SQL.
- Apply least privilege when generating grants, ownership chains, procedure execution patterns, or access-control
  examples.
- Do not generate SQL that broadens permissions beyond the minimum required by the requested behavior.
- Avoid exposing sensitive columns by default in generated queries, views, stored procedures, exports, and diagnostics.
- Prefer designs compatible with column-level protection, row-level security, auditing, and least-privilege access when
  sensitive data is involved.
- Use query hints, table hints, index hints, locking hints, and `OPTION (...)` only as a last resort for a documented
  optimizer, locking, or regression problem.
- Do not add `NOLOCK` or other isolation-affecting hints as a default performance shortcut.
- Document every required hint with the observed problem, target SQL Server version or platform, expected effect, and
  regression risk.
- Use explicit transactions for multi-step data changes that must succeed or fail together.
- Ask for clarification before generating destructive operations when object names, target environment, filter criteria,
  transaction scope, or permission impact are ambiguous.

### Tests

- For non-trivial generated T-SQL, state how correctness should be verified: expected row counts, deterministic
  ordering, affected rows, rollback behavior, permission boundaries, or error paths.
- For performance-sensitive T-SQL, inspect the execution plan instead of guessing.
- Verify that predicates can use expected indexes when performance depends on index usage.
- Verify that generated result sets are deterministic when used for reports, exports, tests, paging, or `TOP (...)`
  operations.
- Test stored procedures with named parameters, missing or invalid inputs, `NULL` inputs, and expected error paths when
  those paths are affected.
- Test transaction logic for success, failure, rollback, and uncommittable transaction behavior when generated code uses
  explicit transactions.
- Test dynamic SQL with safe values, invalid values, boundary lengths, and attempted injection strings when dynamic SQL
  is generated.
- Test `MERGE` behavior with matched rows, unmatched source rows, unmatched target rows, duplicates, and batching
  assumptions when `MERGE` is generated.
- When version-specific syntax or platform-specific behavior is used, verify it against the declared SQL Server product,
  version, and compatibility level.

### Idioms

- Prefer the smallest correct T-SQL solution that satisfies the requested behavior.
- Do not add stored procedures, dynamic SQL, temporary tables, hints, transactions, `MERGE` , or abstractions unless
  they are required by the task.
- Avoid wrapping indexed columns in functions, arithmetic, casts, concatenation, or `CASE` expressions inside `WHERE` or
  `JOIN` predicates when an equivalent sargable predicate is possible.
- Avoid scalar function calls over large result sets unless the design explicitly requires them and the performance cost
  is acceptable.
- Use `UNION ALL` unless duplicate elimination is required.
- Use `MERGE` only when it is simpler and safer than separate `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements.
- Prefer explicit `INSERT` , `UPDATE` , or `DELETE` statements for simple source-to-target changes when they are clearer
  or safer than `MERGE` .
- Keep `MERGE ON` conditions strictly focused on target-source matching.
- Do not move target filtering logic into a `MERGE ON` clause to force performance behavior.
- Do not use `TOP` inside `MERGE` for deterministic batching unless successive batches are explicitly controlled and
  documented.
- Do not generalize SQL Server version-specific behavior to all Microsoft SQL platforms.
- Flag unsafe ambiguity instead of guessing when missing information affects data modification, security, permissions,
  object names, target SQL platform, transaction scope, or destructive operations.

### Other

- Prefer official Microsoft Learn documentation as the primary source for Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL behavior.
- When T-SQL guidance conflicts, prioritize maintained official Microsoft documentation over blogs, forums, videos,
  PDFs, examples, or secondary summaries.
- Treat Microsoft SQL Server Transact-SQL as a SQL dialect with product-specific behavior, not as interchangeable
  generic SQL.
- Isolate vendor-specific syntax, hints, platform assumptions, and compatibility-level dependencies so they can be
  reviewed or changed later.
- State version or platform constraints explicitly for features that apply only to specific SQL Server versions, Azure
  SQL variants, Synapse, Fabric SQL, or compatibility levels.
- Do not claim that generated T-SQL is portable to other SQL databases unless portability was intentionally checked.

## Go

### Naming

- Use `mixedCaps` for unexported identifiers and `MixedCaps` for exported identifiers.
- Do not use `snake_case` for Go identifiers unless an external format or protocol requires it.
- Keep short names acceptable in very small scopes, especially conventional names such as `i`, `r`, `w`, and `ctx`.
- Keep package names short, lowercase, single-word, and descriptive.
- Do not use underscores, mixed caps, vague names, or redundant package prefixes in package names.
- Prefer singular package names when the package represents one cohesive concept.
- Avoid repeating package, receiver, parameter, or return type names in function and method names; use the call site as
  the readability test.
- Do not prefix ordinary getter methods with `Get` ; prefer `Owner()` over `GetOwner()` and reserve `SetOwner()` for
  setters that mutate state.
- Name one-method interfaces after behavior using the conventional `-er` form when it matches established Go usage, such
  as `Reader` , `Writer` , or `Formatter` .

### Formatting

- Format Go code with `gofmt` or `go fmt` before presenting or committing it.
- Do not manually align code, comments, struct fields, imports, or whitespace against `gofmt` ; let the standard
  formatter decide.
- Use Go modules as the default project unit, with one root module by default unless a clear architectural reason
  justifies multiple modules.
- Use `package main` only for executable commands; library code must use domain-specific package names.
- Organize Go packages by cohesive responsibility rather than by technical layer alone.
- Avoid catch-all packages such as `util` , `common` , or `helper` unless the package name is narrowly qualified and
  meaningful.

### Errors

- Return errors explicitly and handle them immediately instead of hiding failures.
- Return `error` values for expected failures; do not use `panic` for ordinary control flow or normal error cases.
- Prefer linear guard clauses and let the successful path continue down the page.
- Avoid unnecessary `else` blocks after `return`, `break`, `continue`, or `goto`.
- Do not ignore returned errors unless the reason is explicit, intentional, and local to the call site.
- At package boundaries, add caller-level context to foreign errors such as the operation, identifier, path, or
  dependency involved.
- Inside the same package, prefer returning the original error when the caller already has enough local context.
- When adding error context, describe the action being attempted with concise phrases such as `loading config` ,
  `fetching user` , or `reserving stock` .
- Avoid noisy error prefixes such as `failed to`, `cannot`, or `error while` when a concise action phrase is clearer.
- Do not repeat details already present in the wrapped error; add higher-level intent instead.
- Do not make callers, dashboards, or alerts depend on exact error message strings.
- When code must branch on an error, expose a sentinel error checked with `errors.Is` or a typed error checked with
  `errors.As` .
- Wrap errors with `%w` only when callers should be able to inspect the underlying error with `errors.Is` or `errors.As`
  .
- Treat `%w` as part of the package API contract because it exposes the wrapped error to callers.
- When the underlying error should not become part of the public contract, return contextual errors without exposing
  implementation details.
- Use `%v` instead of `%w` when the human-readable message is useful but the underlying storage, driver, RPC,
  third-party, or dependency error must remain private.
- At system or dependency boundaries, translate implementation-specific errors into package-owned sentinel errors or
  custom error types.
- Make callers branch on the package domain error vocabulary, not on accidental details of the current storage, client,
  or dependency implementation.
- Use `errors.Is` and `errors.As` for wrapped error inspection; do not compare wrapped errors directly.
- Log an error or return it, but do not do both in the same layer.
- Return recoverable errors upward and let the terminal decision layer log an unhandled error once.
- At outer handlers, check `context.Canceled` and `context.DeadlineExceeded` before treating an error as an application
  failure.
- Use `panic` and `recover` sparingly; recover only inside deferred functions and only at deliberate failure-containment
  boundaries.

### Safety

- Pass `context.Context` explicitly as the first parameter when a function needs deadlines, cancellation, or
  request-scoped values.
- Do not store contexts inside structs, do not pass `nil` contexts, and use `context.TODO()` only when the correct
  context is genuinely unknown.
- Always call the cancellation function returned by `context.WithCancel` , `context.WithDeadline` , or
  `context.WithTimeout` ; use `defer cancel()` when appropriate.
- Use `defer` immediately after successful resource acquisition when cleanup must happen regardless of the return path.
- Remember that `defer` is function-scoped, not block-scoped.
- Prefer channels when they make ownership and sequencing clearer; prefer mutexes when they are simpler for protecting
  shared state.
- Prevent goroutine leaks by defining a clear cancellation or completion path through context cancellation, channel
  closure, or another explicit signal.
- Do not start a goroutine that can fail without providing an observable error path.
- For concurrent work that can fail, use an explicit error collection mechanism such as `errgroup` or a buffered error
  channel.
- Log, signal, or deliberately escalate goroutine errors instead of allowing them to disappear silently.
- Be careful with loop variables captured by closures or goroutines, especially when targeting Go versions before 1.22.
- For Go 1.22 and later, do not apply pre-1.22 loop-variable workarounds blindly; check the project `go.mod` before
  applying version-dependent rules.

### Tests

- Write Go tests in files ending with `_test.go` using `TestXxx` functions.
- Use descriptive test names such as `TestFunctionName_Scenario` when the scenario improves failure diagnosis.
- Use `go test` as the default verification command for package behavior.
- Use table-driven tests for multiple input/output cases when they keep the test logic clearer.
- Use subtests with `t.Run` when cases need names, filtering, parallelism, or isolated setup.
- Keep tests deterministic unless nondeterminism is the behavior under test.
- Avoid hidden test dependencies on wall-clock timing, map iteration order, global mutable state, external services, or
  uncontrolled goroutine scheduling.
- Test failure paths that branch on sentinel errors, typed errors, wrapped errors, cancellation, or dependency-boundary
  translation.
- Do not assert exact error message strings unless the message text is the explicit behavior under test.
- Use `go vet` as a static-analysis safety check, not as proof of correctness.
- Run `go test -race` when tests exercise concurrent paths or when a change affects concurrency-sensitive code.
- After a Go code change, run the smallest meaningful verification set first, usually formatting only touched files or
  packages, `go test` for affected packages, `go vet` when useful, and `go test -race` when justified by the codebase
  and task.

### Idioms

- Prefer Go idioms over verbose names or non-Go naming conventions.
- Prefer concrete types until tests, package boundaries, or alternate implementations justify an interface.
- Keep interfaces small, behavior-focused, and defined near the consumer when practical.
- Document exported public API identifiers with Go doc comments, following repository lint rules.
- Use package comments as complete sentences and avoid duplicate package comments across multiple files.

## PHP

### Naming

- Use `$camelCase` for variables.
- Use `camelCase` for methods and functions.
- Use `PascalCase` for classes, interfaces, traits, and enums.
- Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.

### Formatting

- Follow PSR-12 unless the repository defines another PHP coding standard.
- Enforce PHP formatting with tooling such as PHP_CodeSniffer or PHP-CS-Fixer when available.
- Apply PHP formatters only to touched PHP files unless a project PHP check requires a broader format pass.

### Runtime and Types

- Respect the minimum PHP version declared by `composer.json`, CI, runtime configuration, or project documentation.
- If the minimum PHP version is not discoverable and syntax compatibility matters, ask before using version-specific
  syntax or APIs.
- Declare `strict_types=1` when consistent with the project, and apply it consistently within the touched PHP scope.
- Use typed properties, parameters, and return types when supported by the target PHP version and consistent with the
  surrounding code.
- Use modern PHP features such as constructor property promotion, enums, `match` , and `readonly` only when they improve
  clarity and are supported by the project runtime.
- Use strict comparisons with `===` and `!==` unless loose comparison is required by the domain.

### Errors

- Prefer exceptions over ambiguous `false` or `null` error returns when consistent with the project.
- Use SPL or domain-specific exception types when they make error handling clearer than catching generic `Exception`.
- Do not suppress errors with the `@` error-control operator.

### Input, Output, and Security

- Treat request parameters, cookies, sessions, uploaded files, downloaded files, request bodies, and third-party
  responses as untrusted until validated.
- Validate external input at the boundary before using it in application logic; do not rely on client-side checks or
  previous workflow steps.
- Escape output for the target context, especially HTML, JavaScript, shell commands, SQL, XML, and similar executable
  contexts.
- Use the repository's database abstraction with parameter binding for SQL queries; when writing raw PDO, use prepared
  statements with bound parameters.
- Never concatenate untrusted input into SQL, and still validate writes against business rules.
- Use `password_hash()` and `password_verify()` for password storage; do not design custom password hashing schemes.
- Do not implement custom cryptography for production use; use reviewed libraries or platform APIs.
- Use `filter_var()` with `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL` for ordinary email validation unless the project has a documented and
  tested alternative.
- Confirm email requirements before relying on `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL` for internationalized domains or nonstandard but
  valid address forms.
- Do not sanitize HTML with regular expressions; use contextual escaping or a dedicated sanitizer such as HTML Purifier.
- Do not hardcode secrets in PHP source files or committed PHP configuration; load them through the project's secure
  configuration mechanism.

### Dependencies and Autoloading

- Use Composer for PHP dependency management and autoloading when the project uses Composer.
- Keep namespaces consistent with the project's Composer autoloading configuration.
- Avoid adding new manual `require` or `include` chains for class loading when Composer autoloading is available.
- For applications, preserve or update `composer.lock` when changing Composer dependencies.
- Do not run broad dependency updates unless the task asks for them; prefer the smallest Composer change that satisfies
  the request.

### Text and Dates

- Use UTF-8 consistently across PHP, the database, and the browser; use `utf8mb4` for MySQL connections and schema
  configuration.
- Use `mb_*` functions when character boundaries matter in Unicode strings.
- Use `DateTimeImmutable` or `DateTime` for date and time logic that requires comparison, timezone conversion, or
  mutation.

### Tests and Checks

- When changing PHP behavior, add or update tests in the existing PHP test framework when practical.
- Run the relevant PHP verification command when available, such as `php -l` , PHPUnit, Pest, PHPStan, Psalm,
  PHP_CodeSniffer, PHP-CS-Fixer, or a project script.

### Idioms

- Namespace project classes unless the surrounding PHP code intentionally uses another convention.
- Avoid adding new global state; use the project's existing class, configuration, or function structure.
- In template-oriented PHP, avoid adding new database queries directly to view templates; use the existing controller,
  model, repository, or service layer.

## Laravel

Apply this section to Laravel application code in addition to the generic `PHP`
section. When both sections address the same topic, prefer the Laravel-specific
rule for framework code.

### Naming

- Follow PSR standards and established Laravel naming conventions for classes,
  controllers, models, routes, route names, relationships, tables, columns,
  migrations, methods, variables, views, configuration files, contracts, and
  traits.
- Name Laravel classes according to their framework role, and keep
  framework-generated classes in conventional Laravel locations such as
  controllers, middleware, and form requests under `app/Http`, models under
  `app/Models`, policies under `app/Policies`, jobs under `app/Jobs`, rules
  under `app/Rules`, and tests under `tests`.
- Use PHP enums or Laravel configuration values for repeated statuses and
  literals that must be shared across controllers, jobs, validation rules,
  views, or API resources.

### Formatting

- Follow Laravel's default project structure unless the existing project
  explicitly documents a different structure.
- Prefer Artisan `make:*` commands when generating Laravel framework classes.
- When scaling a codebase, organize code by business domain inside Laravel's
  conventional structure before creating a parallel architecture.
- Keep Blade templates focused on presentation.
- Avoid database queries, heavy business logic, large PHP blocks, and embedded
  JavaScript or CSS in Blade templates.
- Keep frontend assets in the project's asset pipeline instead of embedding
  reusable assets directly in Blade templates.
- Store repeated configurable values in configuration files.
- Store user-facing text in language files when localization or reuse is
  expected.
- Read environment variables only from configuration files.
- In application code, use `config()` values instead of calling `env()`
  directly.
- Use model casts or Carbon objects for Laravel date and datetime handling.
- Format dates at the presentation boundary, not inside persistence logic.

### Errors

- Return accurate HTTP status codes for API success and error cases.
- Do not return a successful `2xx` response for failed operations.
- Make validation, authorization, persistence, and external-service failures
  visible through Laravel's normal exception, validation, logging, and response
  mechanisms.
- Set `APP_DEBUG=false` in production.
- Never expose debug output, stack traces, or sensitive configuration values to
  end users.
- Clear Laravel caches only when needed for deployment or troubleshooting.

### Safety

- Validate external input before using it in Laravel application logic,
  persistence, jobs, API responses, or view rendering.
- Move meaningful validation into dedicated Form Request classes when
  applicable.
- Use Form Request classes for validation rules, authorization checks, and input
  normalization when they fit the request boundary.
- Keep authorization decisions centralized in policies, gates, or Form Request
  authorization methods.
- Do not scatter permission checks across controllers, jobs, Blade templates,
  and helper classes.
- Protect mass assignment by defining `$fillable` or `$guarded` intentionally.
- Persist only validated or explicitly controlled input.
- Never blindly persist untrusted request data.
- Use Laravel's authentication and authorization facilities for APIs, such as
  Sanctum or Passport when token-based authentication is required.
- Use policies or gates for fine-grained API permissions.
- Do not expose raw Eloquent models directly when an API response must hide
  fields, rename fields, or provide a stable response contract.
- Serve Laravel through the `public` directory and route all requests through
  `public/index.php`.
- Never expose the project root as the web root.
- Ensure the web server process can write to `bootstrap/cache` and `storage`.
- Do not solve permission problems with overly broad permissions unless the
  security impact is explicitly accepted.

### Tests

- Put automated tests under `tests`.
- Suffix test classes with `Test`.
- Prefer `php artisan test`, Pest, or PHPUnit according to the project's
  existing tooling.
- Run the existing project test command before presenting behavior-changing work
  as complete.
- When changing behavior, add or update the smallest relevant Laravel test
  before or alongside the code change.
- Prefer feature or HTTP tests for user-visible Laravel behavior.
- Prefer unit tests for isolated domain logic.
- Verify Laravel changes with the narrowest meaningful command first, then run
  broader tests when the change can affect shared behavior.
- State any unverified assumptions, skipped checks, or unavailable runtime
  validations before presenting the work as complete.

### Idioms

- Prefer Laravel's built-in conventions and features before adding custom
  patterns.
- Do not introduce custom architecture, repository layers, DTO systems, or
  enterprise-style abstractions unless they solve a documented project problem.
- Prefer expressive Laravel helpers and idioms when they improve readability,
  such as `session()`, `back()`, `now()`, `latest()`, `value()`, and
  `compact()`.
- Keep controllers thin; controllers should orchestrate request handling,
  authorization, validation, domain calls, and responses.
- Do not place database-heavy logic, complex business workflows, or repeated
  domain rules directly in controllers.
- Extract business workflows into service, action, or job classes when the
  logic has a clear responsibility outside request orchestration.
- Use queued jobs for slow, retryable, asynchronous, or external-service work.
- Split a controller method when validation, authorization, persistence,
  notifications, and response building are mixed together.
- Prefer Eloquent relationships, scopes, casts, accessors, mutators, and
  collections for model-centered application data access.
- Use Laravel Query Builder for aggregate, reporting, bulk, or cross-table
  queries that are clearer outside Eloquent models.
- Use raw SQL only when Laravel's Eloquent and Query Builder APIs are
  unsuitable, performance has been measured, or the project already uses that
  pattern.
- Fetch data in controllers, services, actions, view models, or query objects,
  then pass prepared data to views.
- Prevent N+1 query problems with eager loading, relationship counts, selective
  columns, and strict loading checks where appropriate.
- Load only the data required by the current use case.
- Use Eloquent scopes or dedicated query builders to remove repeated query
  fragments.
- Return a query builder from reusable query constraints instead of executing
  the query too early.
- Use chunking, lazy iteration, pagination, or cursor-based approaches for
  large datasets.
- Do not load an unbounded table into memory for data-heavy tasks.
- Use API Resources when returning JSON responses so the response shape is
  explicit, stable, and controlled.
- Paginate large API responses.
- Expose pagination metadata through Laravel's paginator or resource
  collections when relevant.
- Version public or client-consumed APIs when breaking changes are possible.
- Do not generate HTML inside unrelated PHP service classes.

### Other

- For AI-assisted coding, rely on project-local Laravel conventions, project
  documentation, and version-specific Laravel documentation before suggesting
  framework syntax.
- In production deployments, cache configuration, routes, events, and views
  using Laravel's deployment optimization commands where applicable.
- Restart or reload long-running Laravel processes after deployment, including
  queue workers, Reverb, and Octane.
- Configure a process monitor for long-running Laravel processes when the
  deployment platform does not manage them.
- Use Laravel's health route or a documented health-check mechanism for uptime
  monitors, load balancers, or orchestration systems.

## Java

### Naming

- Use `camelCase` for variables, fields, and methods.
- Use `PascalCase` for classes, interfaces, records, and enums.
- Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
- Keep package names lowercase.

### Formatting

- Encode Java source files in UTF-8 and do not introduce non-standard whitespace characters.
- Prefer one top-level Java type per source file, and make the `.java` file name match the case-sensitive public
  top-level type when one exists.
- Keep Java source files structurally ordered: license or copyright block, package declaration, imports, then the
  top-level type declaration.
- Do not use wildcard imports.
- Use explicit imports only, and keep static imports separated from non-static imports.
- Keep overloaded methods and constructors contiguous.
- Always use braces for `if`, `else`, `for`, `do`, and `while`, even for single-statement bodies.
- Use one executable statement per line.
- Keep line length under 100 characters unless the project style guide allows an explicit exception.
- Prefer clear line wrapping over dense one-line code or fragile horizontal alignment.
- Use blank lines to separate logical groups, not to create visual noise.

### Errors

- Keep checked and unchecked exception usage consistent with the project.
- Never ignore caught exceptions silently.
- Handle caught exceptions by logging, rethrowing, returning a meaningful fallback, or documenting why ignoring the
  exception is safe.
- Catch the most specific exception type that the code can handle meaningfully.
- Do not catch broad exceptions unless the handling is intentional and specific.
- Use `try-with-resources` for resources that implement `AutoCloseable`.
- Do not log and rethrow the same exception unless the catch block adds meaningful context.

### Safety

- Prefer immutable fields with `final` when practical.
- Favor immutable objects when state should not change after construction.
- Use constructor initialization and avoid setters where immutable behavior is intended.
- Keep fields private by default, and expose behavior through methods when appropriate.
- Do not expose instance or class fields publicly without a clear structural reason.
- Avoid returning `null` for collections; return an empty collection when appropriate.
- Avoid circular dependencies between Java packages or JPMS modules.
- Express domain-significant Java constants as `static final` constants, enums, or configuration values.
- Avoid embedded assignments when they reduce readability.
- Access static members through the class name, not through an instance.
- Do not override `Object.finalize`.
- When changing Java dependencies or build files, use the project's dependency audit tooling when available.

### Tests

- Use the project's Java test framework for behavior that must not regress.
- Prefer unit tests for local Java logic and integration tests for Java component boundaries.
- Use Java test method names or display names that communicate the behavior under test and the expected outcome.
- Run the smallest meaningful verification set after a Java change, covering compilation, tests, formatting, imports,
  exception handling, dependency impact, and behavior preservation.
- Use Maven, Gradle, or the project's Java dependency tooling when changing dependencies, and run tests before accepting
  dependency changes.

### Idioms

- Use `switch` expressions or statements when supported by the project's configured Java version and when they make
  multi-branch selection clearer than repeated `if else` chains.
- Do not replace simple conditions with `switch` unless it improves readability.
- Document intentional `switch` fall-through with a local comment at the fall-through point.
- Prefer collections over arrays when dynamic size, generics, or collection operations are needed.
- Use arrays when fixed-size, low-level, or interoperability constraints justify them.
- Use enhanced `for` loops when index management is unnecessary.
- Use streams when filtering, mapping, or aggregation is clearer than imperative iteration.
- Do not use streams when they obscure simple control flow.
- Use lambdas for functional interfaces when they reduce boilerplate and remain readable.
- Keep lambda bodies short; extract named methods when lambda bodies become complex.
- Use `@Override` whenever overriding or implementing a method.

### Other

- Write Javadoc for public APIs and behavior that external callers must understand.
- Begin each Javadoc block with a concise summary fragment.
- Keep Javadoc block tags meaningful and non-empty.
- Do not write empty `@param`, `@return`, `@throws`, or `@deprecated` descriptions.
- Add a Java interface or abstract class only when the current Java code has a concrete, repeated need for it.
- Do not generalize Spring, Maven, Gradle, Google Cloud, IDE-specific, or framework-specific guidance to all Java code.
- Apply framework-specific guidance only when the project context uses that framework or tool.
- When Java guidance conflicts, prefer maintained, official, or project-local standards over archived or vendor-blog
  guidance.

## Java Properties Files

### Naming

- Use `.properties` as the standard filename suffix for Java properties resources.
- Use stable, descriptive, dot-separated property keys that reflect the configuration domain.
- Avoid vague property keys such as `value`, `flag`, `url1`, or `temp`.
- Treat localization property keys as durable identifiers and do not rename them casually.
- Translate property values, not property keys, unless the project has an explicit key-localization mechanism.

### Formatting

- Represent Java `.properties` files as string-based key-value configuration resources.
- Convert property values to typed values explicitly in application code after loading and validation.
- Use one consistent assignment style in each generated file, preferably `key=value`.
- Do not mix `key=value`, `key = value`, `key:value`, and whitespace-separated forms in the same file.
- Use comments starting with `#` or `!` only to clarify purpose, units, accepted values, default behavior, or
  operational warnings.
- Do not use large blocks of commented-out alternatives as the primary configuration mechanism.
- Document non-obvious or mandatory properties close to the property they describe.
- Preserve intentional leading, trailing, and embedded whitespace in property values.
- Choose the file encoding deliberately and document non-default encoding expectations.
- For classic `java.util.Properties` compatibility, avoid raw characters outside ISO-8859-1 unless the loading code
  explicitly uses an encoding-aware path.
- Escape syntax-sensitive characters only when required by the properties format or the selected parser.
- Pay special attention to `#` , `!` , `=` , `:` , backslashes, leading spaces, tabs, logical newlines, and Unicode
  escape sequences.
- Use escaped `\n` for logical newlines inside values unless physical multiline continuation is explicitly intended.
- Use line continuation only when it improves readability and the target parser supports it.
- When using continuation lines, ensure the trailing backslash and continuation indentation do not change the expected
  value.
- Do not escape single or double quotes unless the consuming framework, message formatter, or localization tool requires
  it.

### Errors

- Treat missing mandatory properties as configuration errors instead of silently substituting unsafe defaults.
- Use `getProperty(key, defaultValue)` only when the default value is semantically valid and safe.
- Do not use Java default property lists to hide incomplete or invalid configuration.
- Validate and report invalid typed conversions for integers, booleans, durations, URLs, paths, enums, and similar typed
  values.
- Do not duplicate property keys unless the selected runtime explicitly documents duplicate-key or repeated-key
  behavior.
- For plain `java.util.Properties`, do not rely on duplicate keys as a list mechanism.

### Safety

- Do not store production secrets, credentials, tokens, passwords, private URLs, or API keys in properties files.
- Represent secrets as placeholders or runtime-injected values and document the expected secure source.
- Do not generalize Spring Boot behavior to plain Java properties files.
- Apply Spring Boot-specific rules only when the target project explicitly uses Spring or Spring Boot.
- Do not use Apache Commons Configuration features unless the target project explicitly uses Apache Commons
  Configuration.
- Treat `include` , `includeOptional` , delimiter-based lists, repeated keys as lists, and builder-based saving as
  parser-specific behavior.
- When using Apache Commons Configuration lists, configure delimiter handling explicitly instead of assuming
  comma-separated values are split automatically.

### Tests

- Validate generated or modified properties files for syntax, duplicate keys, encoding, missing mandatory values, and
  unintentionally unescaped syntax-sensitive characters.
- Test application-level conversion and validation for every property value that becomes a typed value.
- Test missing mandatory properties and invalid values on affected configuration paths.
- Test localization properties for missing keys, placeholder consistency, syntax, encoding, and unescaped characters.
- When parser-specific behavior is used, test the behavior with the actual parser used by the project.

### Idioms

- Use `getProperty()` for normal reads from `java.util.Properties` ; do not use inherited `Hashtable.get()` for ordinary
  property lookup.
- Use `setProperty()` for normal writes to `java.util.Properties` ; do not use inherited `put()` or `putAll()` for
  ordinary property updates.
- Use `store()` or `storeToXML()` when serializing a `Properties` object unless a custom layout must be preserved.
- Use XML properties only when XML format, XML tooling, or explicit XML encoding behavior is required.
- Load and save persisted properties from stable, well-known locations.
- Use Java default property lists only for real fallback layers that are intentionally overridden by
  application-specific values.
- Use the placeholder convention expected by the consuming formatter for localized values.
- Use numbered or ICU-style placeholders only when the consuming parser explicitly supports that convention.

### Other

- For Spring Boot projects, keep shared values in `application.properties` and environment-specific values in
  profile-specific files such as `application-dev.properties` , `application-test.properties` , and
  `application-prod.properties` .
- Keep one language or locale per localization properties file.
- Keep Spring Boot, Apache Commons Configuration, and localization rules conditional to avoid applying
  framework-specific behavior to plain Java properties files.

## TypeScript

### Naming

- Use `camelCase` for variables and functions.
- Use `PascalCase` for classes, interfaces, type aliases, and enums.
- Use `UPPER_CASE` for global compile-time constants only when the project
  already uses that convention.
- Keep TypeScript names descriptive and avoid encoding type information that the
  type system already exposes.
- Keep interfaces small, focused, and limited to one coherent consumer or
  responsibility.
- Avoid empty interfaces because they do not define a meaningful contract.

### Formatting

- Match the existing project formatting, module style, semicolon policy, and
  linting setup before applying a generic TypeScript convention.
- Use ES module syntax with `import` and `export` for normal module boundaries.
- Do not use `namespace` for ordinary code organization.
- Do not use TypeScript `require` import syntax unless legacy interoperability
  or third-party constraints require it.
- End statements with explicit semicolons when the project style allows or
  requires semicolons.
- Use TypeScript-aware ESLint and Prettier when they are already configured or
  explicitly introduced for the project.
- Do not rely on manual formatting or ad hoc review to enforce TypeScript style
  when automated checks are available.

### Errors

- Type callback return values as `void` when the caller intentionally ignores
  the returned value.
- Do not type ignored callback returns as `any`.
- Do not mark callback parameters optional unless the callback may actually be
  invoked without those arguments.
- When using overloads, order signatures from the most specific to the most
  general.
- Use overloads only when call shapes or return types genuinely differ.
- Do not write overloads that only add trailing parameters with the same return
  type; use optional parameters for that shape.
- Treat failed narrowing, invalid external data, and unsafe assertions as design
  errors to fix at the boundary where the value enters the typed code.

### Safety

- Enable strict type checking for new TypeScript projects; at minimum, keep
  `strict` enabled and do not hide implicit `any` errors.
- Avoid `any` in maintained code.
- Use explicit domain types when the value shape is known.
- Use `unknown` when a value is intentionally not known yet, then narrow it
  before reading properties, calling methods, or passing it into typed APIs.
- Use primitive type names such as `string`, `number`, `boolean`, and `symbol`.
- Do not use boxed primitive types such as `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`,
  `Symbol`, or `Object` as ordinary value types.
- Use `object` or a more precise object shape for non-primitive objects.
- Check optional properties for `undefined`, use optional chaining, or narrow the
  value before accessing nested members or calling methods.
- Prefer runtime narrowing with `typeof`, `instanceof`, property checks, or
  discriminants before using a value as a narrower type.
- Use `as` assertions only when a clear local invariant exists that TypeScript
  cannot infer, and document why the assertion is safe when the reason is not
  obvious.
- Treat JSON, API responses, user input, environment variables, and persisted
  data as untrusted until validated or narrowed at runtime.
- Use `readonly` for properties that must be assigned only during object
  creation or initialization.

### Tests

- Run the smallest relevant TypeScript verification set after a TypeScript
  change, including type checking, linting, formatting, and tests when the
  project provides them.
- Verify that generated or modified TypeScript compiles under the project's
  configured strictness level.
- Add or update tests when TypeScript behavior changes, especially for invalid
  inputs, boundary values, external-data validation, and narrowing-dependent
  branches.
- Test public API contracts when exported function signatures, return shapes,
  interfaces, type aliases, or generics change.
- Treat ESLint, Prettier, and `tsc` as quality gates when they are part of the
  project toolchain.

### Idioms

- Prefer TypeScript inference for clear local implementation details.
- Add explicit types where they clarify public APIs, document non-obvious
  intent, or protect contracts from accidental changes.
- Type exported functions, public methods, callbacks, and reusable library
  boundaries explicitly at their parameters.
- Add return types when the return shape is part of the public contract,
  complex, or likely to be accidentally changed.
- Model finite string or numeric values with literal unions instead of broad
  `string` or `number` types.
- Prefer union types over overloads when only one parameter varies by type.
- Use type aliases for unions, primitives, tuples, intersections, and
  composition that interfaces cannot express cleanly.
- Use interfaces for reusable object shapes and class contracts when extension
  or structural typing is the clearest expression.
- Use the simplest type construct that accurately expresses the contract.
- Avoid mapped types, conditional types, and complex generic abstractions unless
  they materially improve correctness or remove real duplication.
- Introduce generics only when a type parameter connects meaningful positions,
  such as input to output, key to object, or container to contained value.
- Use generic constraints such as `Key extends keyof Type` when they prevent
  invalid property access.
- Avoid return-type-only generics in new APIs.
- Use standard utility types such as `Partial`, `Required`, `Readonly`, `Pick`,
  and `Record` only when they make the transformation of an existing type
  clearer than an explicit type.

### Other

- Document exported APIs, top-level exports, public members, and non-obvious
  properties or methods with useful JSDoc when intent is not clear from the
  signature and name.
- Do not write comments that merely repeat TypeScript identifiers or restate
  obvious type information.
- Do not add TypeScript tooling, transpiler configuration, linter configuration,
  formatter configuration, or framework-specific rules unless the task or
  existing project context requires them.
- Prefer official TypeScript documentation, project-local conventions, and
  maintained style guides over generic examples when TypeScript guidance
  conflicts.

## JavaScript

### Naming

- Use clear variable, function, class, and module names that describe observable behavior or domain meaning.
- Avoid reusing one variable for different semantic meanings.
- Use function names that describe the action performed or the value returned.
- Avoid boolean flag parameters when they create multiple hidden code paths; split the behavior into separate functions
  instead.
- Keep callback and inline function names or parameters clear enough that the caller intent remains visible.

### Formatting

- Match the existing project style before introducing any JavaScript formatting convention.
- Use the repository formatter when one is already configured.
- Keep indentation, spacing, string quoting, semicolon policy, and module style consistent within the same repository.
- Prefer clear code over clever or overly compact expressions.
- Do not compress multiple operations into one expression when it hides intent.
- Keep comments focused on why a JavaScript decision exists, not on what the code plainly does.
- Remove stale comments when changing the behavior they describe.
- Use JSDoc only when it clarifies public API contracts, complex types, or non-obvious behavior.

### Errors

- Always handle rejected promises.
- Do not intentionally ignore a promise unless the reason is documented and safe.
- Use `try` / `catch` around awaited operations when the function can recover, add context, translate the error, or
  perform required cleanup.
- Do not swallow errors silently.
- Throw `Error` objects or project-standard error subclasses, not strings or arbitrary values.
- Preserve the original error context when wrapping errors.
- Add actionable context to errors close to the failure source.
- Do not catch an error unless the function can recover, enrich it, translate it, or perform required cleanup.
- Do not hide operational failures behind default fallback values unless the fallback is explicitly safe.
- Keep error messages specific enough to debug without exposing secrets.
- Validate function preconditions at public boundaries.

### Safety

- Treat all external input as untrusted.
- Validate input at application boundaries before using it in business logic.
- Normalize external input types at system boundaries before using them internally.
- Use explicit parsing for numbers, booleans, dates, and JSON-derived values.
- Use sink-specific escaping, encoding, validation, or parameterized APIs before sending data to HTML, URLs, SQL, shell
  commands, logs, or other sensitive sinks.
- Never build executable code from user-controlled strings.
- Avoid `eval` , `Function` , and string-based dynamic execution unless there is a documented, reviewed, and unavoidable
  reason.
- Validate JSON shape before trusting parsed content.
- Protect against prototype pollution when merging or deserializing untrusted objects.
- Avoid mutating function parameters unless mutation is the explicit purpose of the function.
- Do not expose mutable internal state directly from modules or classes.
- Do not use objects as dictionaries for untrusted keys without guarding against inherited properties and prototype
  pollution.
- Keep browser-only APIs such as `window` , `document` , `localStorage` , and DOM APIs out of Node.js code unless the
  runtime explicitly provides them.
- Keep Node.js APIs such as `fs` , `path` , `process` , and server-side modules out of browser code unless a bundler or
  polyfill strategy is explicitly defined.

### Tests

- Add or update tests when changing JavaScript behavior.
- For bug fixes, write a test that reproduces the bug before or alongside the fix.
- Test invalid inputs, boundary cases, and asynchronous failure paths.
- Keep test fixtures small and explicit.
- Avoid snapshot tests for logic-heavy code unless the snapshot is stable and easy to review.
- Do not mock standard JavaScript language behavior; mock external systems and unstable boundaries instead.
- After a JavaScript change, verify the affected runtime behavior, promise rejection handling, module loading, input
  coercion, and browser or Node.js boundary assumptions.

### Idioms

- Use `const` by default for bindings that are not reassigned.
- Use `let` only when reassignment is required.
- Do not use `var` in new code.
- Declare variables in the narrowest practical scope.
- Initialize variables close to their first meaningful use.
- Avoid implicit globals; every variable must be explicitly declared.
- Use `===` and `!==` by default.
- Use `==` or `!=` only when type coercion is intentional, documented, and covered by tests.
- Do not rely on implicit type conversion for business logic.
- Do not compare complex objects by reference unless reference identity is the intended behavior.
- Prefer `async` / `await` for promise-based asynchronous flows when it improves readability.
- Avoid deeply nested promise chains; flatten the control flow or extract helper functions.
- Keep concurrent operations explicit with `Promise.all` , `Promise.allSettled` , or sequential `await` , depending on
  failure semantics.
- Organize reusable code into modules with explicit imports and exports.
- Avoid hidden global dependencies between files.
- Prefer named exports for shared utilities when multiple functions are exported from the same module.
- Use default exports only when the module clearly exposes one primary concept.
- Avoid circular dependencies; if they appear, extract shared logic into a lower-level module.
- Keep module boundaries aligned with responsibilities, not arbitrary file size.
- Prefer immutable data transformations when they make intent clearer.
- Use object destructuring only when it improves readability.
- Prefer `Map` or `Set` when key-value or uniqueness semantics are clearer than plain objects or arrays.
- Use classes only when state and behavior naturally belong together.
- Prefer simple functions and plain objects when no object lifecycle is needed.
- Keep constructors simple; avoid asynchronous work or heavy side effects in constructors.
- Use private fields or closure-based encapsulation for internal state when supported by the target runtime.
- Prefer composition over inheritance unless inheritance clearly models the domain.
- Do not create abstract base classes or inheritance hierarchies speculatively.

### Other

- Always identify the target JavaScript runtime before generating code: browser, Node.js, embedded platform, or mixed
  runtime.
- Prefer standard JavaScript features documented by MDN before introducing third-party dependencies.
- Do not generalize framework-specific practices to JavaScript as a language rule unless the target project explicitly
  uses that framework.
- Do not add a dependency for functionality that can be implemented clearly with standard JavaScript in a few lines.
- Do not add framework, bundler, transpiler, linter, formatter, or test-runner configuration unless explicitly requested
  or required by the existing project.
- Start with readable JavaScript, then optimize only when there is a measured bottleneck or a known runtime constraint.
- Avoid unnecessary work inside loops, render cycles, event handlers, and frequently called callbacks.
- Cache repeated expensive computations only when the cache lifecycle is clear.
- Avoid blocking the main thread in browser code with heavy synchronous work.
- Avoid synchronous file operations in server code paths that must remain responsive.
- Use lazy loading or dynamic imports only when they solve a real loading or dependency boundary problem.
- Do not introduce micro-optimizations that make code harder to maintain without measurable benefit.

## Bash

### Naming

- Use lowercase variable names for local script variables, such as `file_path` and `retry_count`.
- Reserve uppercase variable names for environment variables, constants, and exported configuration.
- Use `local` for function-scoped variables to avoid leaking temporary state into the global scope.
- Name Bash functions after the command action or question they implement, such as `build_archive` or `is_valid_tag`.

### Formatting

- Start Bash scripts with an explicit Bash shebang. Use the project standard when one exists; otherwise prefer
  `#!/usr/bin/env bash` for user-space portability or `#!/bin/bash` for controlled system environments.
- Do not use Bash-only syntax under `#!/bin/sh` ; arrays, `[[ ... ]]` , `local` , and `${BASH_SOURCE[@]}` require a Bash
  shebang.
- Preserve the existing Bash dialect, shebang style, strict-mode usage, and function layout when editing existing
  scripts.
- For new Bash files without a project style, use readable shell indentation, short lines, and consistent command
  layout.
- For user-facing Bash scripts, keep usage or help text in one reusable block when that avoids duplicated output for
  `-h` , `--help` , and invalid options.
- Add a function header comment only when a Bash function's purpose, globals, arguments, output, or return behavior is
  not obvious from the code.

### Errors

- Check command failures explicitly when continuing after an error is valid.
- Do not rely on strict mode alone; handle expected failures with explicit control flow such as
  `if ! command; then ... fi`, a documented fallback, or a justified `|| true`.
- Send diagnostics, warnings, and errors to STDERR; reserve STDOUT for normal script output.
- For recurring operational Bash scripts, route diagnostics through a small logging function when that improves
  consistency or troubleshooting; keep one-off scripts simple.
- For Bash diagnostics or logging, use `printf` or a logging helper instead of bare `echo` when message formatting,
  timestamps, or STDERR routing matter.
- Preserve command substitution status when it matters by separating `local` declaration from assignment, for example
  `local value` followed by `value="$(command)"` .
- Fail early with clear error messages when required arguments, files, directories, commands, or environment variables
  are missing or invalid.

### Safety

- Use Bash only when Bash is the declared target; treat Bash and POSIX shell as distinct languages.
- Respect the target Bash version; avoid Bash 4+ features such as `readarray` , `mapfile` , or associative arrays unless
  the target runtime supports them.
- Keep Bash scripts limited to small utilities, glue code, wrappers, automation, and command orchestration; recommend a
  higher-level language when logic, data processing, or long-term maintenance becomes complex.
- For new non-trivial Bash scripts, use `set -euo pipefail` after checking that the script behaves correctly under those
  modes. When editing existing scripts, preserve existing strict-mode behavior unless the change requires it and
  representative checks pass.
- Document any omitted or intentionally disabled strict-mode option.
- Quote variable expansions by default, preferably as `"${var}"` , unless word splitting or glob expansion is
  deliberately required and justified.
- Validate shell-facing inputs before they affect commands, paths, or destructive operations, including parsed options,
  positional arguments, environment variables, filenames, command output, and data read from standard input.
- When a Bash script needs runtime configuration, read configurable values from parsed options, environment variables,
  or config files with explicit defaults and validation; do not add configurability that the task or script contract
  does not require.
- Make rerunnable Bash jobs idempotent when they are intended for cron, CI retries, deployment, or maintenance; avoid
  adding state tracking only for speculative reuse.
- Use file locking for Bash scripts that must not run concurrently, and release locks through the script cleanup path.
- Use arrays for dynamic command argument lists, then expand them with `"${array[@]}"` ; do not store multiple command
  arguments in a single string.
- Do not generate `eval` unless the user explicitly requests it and every evaluated input is strictly controlled; prefer
  arrays, case statements, direct invocation, or explicit parsing.
- Never parse `ls` output to process files; use globs, `find`, Bash tests, or null-delimited processing.
- Do not iterate over command output with `for var in $(...)` unless the output is explicitly controlled and
  whitespace-safe; prefer `while IFS= read -r` , `readarray` when supported by the target Bash version, or
  null-delimited `find -print0` processing.
- Use `trap` for cleanup when scripts create temporary files, locks, or reversible state changes.
- Create temporary files and directories with `mktemp` ; do not use predictable names based on process IDs, timestamps,
  or hardcoded paths.
- Prefer explicit path prefixes such as `./*` for globs in the current directory, especially before passing filenames to
  destructive commands.
- Configure glob behavior intentionally when it affects correctness, such as enabling `nullglob` for empty matches or
  documenting any use of `set -f` .
- Do not generate SUID or SGID shell scripts; recommend `sudo` or a safer privileged wrapper when elevated privileges
  are required.
- Enable debug tracing only behind an explicit opt-in flag or environment variable; never enable `set -x`
  unconditionally in production scripts.

### Tests

- Run `bash -n` before accepting generated Bash code.
- Check and format every Bash shell script with `shfmt` when `shfmt` is installed or provided by the project's
  toolchain.
- If `shfmt` is not installed, unavailable, or inaccessible, explicitly warn the user and use the best available
  fallback formatting check, such as preserving the local style and manually reviewing indentation, line wrapping,
  quoting, and command layout.
- Treat every `shfmt` error as a blocking defect to fix before presenting Bash changes as final, and explicitly report
  the `shfmt` result to the user.
- Check every Bash shell script with `shellcheck` when `shellcheck` is installed or provided by the project's toolchain.
- If `shellcheck` is not installed, unavailable, or inaccessible, explicitly warn the user and use the best available
  fallback static check, such as `bash -n` plus manual review for quoting, unset variables, command substitution status,
  unsafe word splitting, and fragile argument handling.
- Treat every `shellcheck` error as a blocking defect to fix before presenting Bash changes as final, and explicitly
  report the `shellcheck` result to the user.
- Bash shell scripts must not have unresolved `shellcheck` errors.
- For Bash scripts, exercise nonzero exit paths and missing argument, missing file, or missing command cases when they
  are affected by a change.
- Verify scripts that use strict mode, traps, globs, temporary files, or argument forwarding with representative inputs
  before presenting them as final.

### Idioms

- Use `[[ ... ]]` for Bash conditionals; use `[ ... ]` only when POSIX shell compatibility is required.
- Use `[[ -z "${var:-}" ]]` and `[[ -n "${var:-}" ]]` when the variable may be unset; use `"${var}"` only when the
  variable is guaranteed to be set.
- Use arithmetic contexts such as `(( count > 0 ))` for numeric comparisons and arithmetic expressions.
- Use `"$@"` when forwarding positional arguments; justify any use of `$*`.
- Prefer `$(...)` over backticks for command substitution.
- Use a `main` function for scripts that contain helper functions or meaningful control flow, and end non-library
  scripts with `main "$@"` .
- Prefer functions over aliases inside scripts.
- Prefer `printf` over `echo` for predictable output.

### Other

- User-facing Bash scripts that accept options should support `-h` or `--help` , print usage information, and reject
  unknown options with a clear error.

## Python

### Naming

- Use `snake_case` for variables, functions, methods, modules, and packages.
- Keep module and package names short, lowercase, and descriptive.
- Use `PascalCase` / `CapWords` for classes and exceptions.
- Add the `Error` suffix to exception classes when the exception represents an error.
- Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
- Define shared constants at module level when they represent fixed configuration or domain values.
- Avoid visually ambiguous single-character names such as `l`, `O`, and `I`.
- Use `self` for instance methods and `cls` for class methods.
- Use a trailing underscore when a name conflicts with a Python keyword, such as `class_`.

### Formatting

- Follow the repository's established Python style before applying generic Python style rules.
- Follow PEP 8 when the repository has no stronger local convention.
- Use 4 spaces per indentation level and never mix tabs and spaces for Python indentation.
- Keep line length consistent with the project; if no project rule exists, default to 79 characters for code and 72
  characters for long comments or docstrings.
- Prefer implicit line continuation inside parentheses, brackets, and braces.
- Avoid backslash continuations unless compatibility constraints require them.
- Place imports at the top of the file after module comments and docstrings.
- Group imports in this order: standard library, third-party packages, then local application imports.
- Separate import groups with one blank line.
- Use one import per line for modules.
- Prefer absolute imports for clarity and safer resolution.
- Avoid wildcard imports.

### Errors

- Prefer explicit exceptions over silent failure or ambiguous return values.
- Use exception types that make the failure mode clear to callers.
- Keep expected failure handling explicit at the call site or at a deliberate boundary.
- Do not suppress Python exceptions without a local, documented reason.
- Do not expose debug tracebacks or internal exception details to end users in production behavior.

### Safety

- Avoid mutable default arguments.
- Use `None` as the default sentinel when a default value must be created per call.
- Use context managers for files, locks, network connections, transactions, and other managed resources when the object
  supports them.
- Validate and sanitize untrusted input before it reaches file paths, shell commands, database queries, deserialization,
  or sensitive business logic.
- Use prepared statements or parameterized queries for database access.
- Never build SQL queries by concatenating untrusted input.
- Never hardcode secrets such as passwords, API keys, tokens, private URLs, or credentials.
- Keep development and production behavior separate; debug output, verbose errors, and permissive settings must not leak
  into production runtime.
- Prefer the Python standard library before adding a third-party dependency.
- Justify every new Python dependency and keep dependency changes minimal.
- Use the project's isolated Python environment when installing or running dependencies, such as `venv` , Poetry, uv,
  Conda, Docker, or the repository's documented workflow.
- Check package names carefully before installation to reduce typo-squatting and dependency-confusion risk.
- Respect the Python versions and dependency constraints declared by the project.
- Do not upgrade Python or dependencies blindly when the project declares supported runtime targets.

### Tests

- Use the project's existing Python test framework and test layout before introducing any new testing convention.
- Run `ruff check` against every generated or modified Python file when Ruff is installed, available, and accessible in
  the working environment.
- Use the repository's existing Ruff configuration when one exists; do not add or change Ruff configuration unless the
  user explicitly requests it.
- Treat `ruff check` syntax failures as blocking defects. Treat Ruff lint findings as defects unless they conflict with
  a verified project convention or an explicitly documented compatibility requirement.
- Do not disable, relax, or bypass Ruff rules to make Python pass unless the user explicitly requests that configuration
  change.
- Use `ruff check --fix` only when the fix is reviewed, scoped to files already in the current task, and does not create
  unrelated formatting or behavior changes.
- If Ruff is not installed, unavailable, or inaccessible, explicitly warn the user and use the best available fallback
  check, such as the project's configured Python linter, `python -m py_compile`, `python -m compileall`, the project
  test command, an available type checker, or a manual review against this Python section.
- State that fallback validation does not replace a successful `ruff check` run.
- When available and configured, also run the relevant Python formatter, type checker, tests, and coverage checks.
- Do not treat Ruff as a substitute for tests, type checking, runtime validation, dependency checks, or security review
  when those are relevant to correctness.
- If checks cannot be run, state exactly which Python checks were skipped and why.

### Idioms

- Prefer f-strings for string interpolation when supported by the project's Python version.
- Add type hints when they improve clarity or match project conventions.
- Compare singletons with identity operators, such as `is None` and `is not None`.
- Do not use `== None` or `!= None`.
- Do not rely on truthiness when `None` has a distinct meaning from valid false values such as `0`, `""`, or `[]`.
- Avoid implementation-specific assumptions when portable Python code is expected.
- Use `__all__` when a module deliberately exposes a public API.
- Do not rely on indirectly imported names as public API unless the re-export is explicitly documented.

### Other

- Use docstrings for modules, public classes, and public functions when they are part of the public API or when project
  conventions require them.
- Keep docstrings concise, accurate, and aligned with the implemented behavior.
- Treat undocumented interfaces as internal unless project documentation says otherwise.
- Use a single leading underscore for non-public names.
- Do not expose internal names as part of a public API by accident.
- Import public names from the module that actually defines them unless a documented re-export exists.
- Do not generalize framework-specific advice to all Python code.
- Apply framework, library, or runtime-version rules only when the project context confirms they are relevant.

## Perl

### Naming

- Use `snake_case` for local variables and subroutines unless the project uses another convention.
- Use mnemonic identifiers that reveal role and intent.
- Avoid single-letter names except for established Perl conventions such as `$a` and `$b` in sort blocks or very small
  local scopes.
- Prefer underscore-separated lexical variable names such as `$file_path` or `$retry_count` for longer local
  identifiers.
- Use normal Perl module names that start with a capital letter unless the module is intentionally pragma-like or the
  project already uses another convention.
- Use a leading underscore for private package variables or subroutines when it helps distinguish package internals from
  public API.

### Formatting

- Enforce one coherent Perl layout style for the project.
- Use `perltidy` when it is available and configured by the repository; do not reformat unrelated Perl files.
- Prefer four-space indentation, spaces instead of tabs, one statement per line, whitespace around binary operators, and
  trailing commas in multiline lists.
- Group related statements into readable paragraphs and separate unrelated code chunks with blank lines.
- Prefer the clearest Perl construct over the shortest construct.
- Avoid clever one-liners in maintained code when an expanded form is easier to read, test, debug, or maintain.
- Parenthesize expressions when precedence, argument binding, or context could be ambiguous to a maintainer.
- Use block `if` statements for non-trivial decisions; reserve postfix `if` for short, obvious, low-risk statements.
- Keep conditions simple, prefer positive phrasing when practical, and make control-flow variations visible.
- Use loop labels only when they clarify multi-level `last`, `next`, or `redo` control flow.

### Errors

- Check the return value of file, directory, process, and system operations.
- Handle failures from `open`, `opendir`, `chdir`, `mkdir`, `system`, `exec`, and similar operations explicitly.
- Include the failed operation, relevant argument, and system error in diagnostics when practical.
- Use lexical filehandles and explicit modes, such as `open(my $fh, '<', $path)`.
- Avoid bareword filehandles and ambiguous two-argument `open`.
- Use list-form `system` or `exec` when invoking external commands and shell interpolation is not required.
- Use `system` instead of backticks when the command output is not needed.
- Do not use backticks in void context.

### Safety

- Enable strictness and warnings in every maintained Perl source file with `use strict;` and `use warnings;` , unless
  legacy compatibility explicitly prevents it.
- Use `use v5.36;` or newer as a strictness substitute only when the project explicitly supports that minimum Perl
  version.
- Do not use `-w` or `$^W` as substitutes for lexical warnings because they can affect code outside the current file.
- Limit every `no strict` or `no warnings` relaxation to the smallest possible scope and document why it is required.
- Use `my` for lexical variables by default.
- Avoid symbolic references unless a well-contained metaprogramming pattern requires them.
- Prefer native Perl built-ins and modules over shelling out for ordinary file, text, or process operations.
- Treat external input as untrusted before using it in file paths, shell commands, database queries, HTML output, or
  security-sensitive contexts.
- Validate, normalize, and constrain untrusted input at the boundary where it enters the program.
- Use DBI placeholders for parameterized database queries.
- Do not interpolate untrusted values into SQL.
- Use allowlists for dynamic SQL identifiers when identifiers cannot be parameterized.
- Use taint-aware patterns for legacy CGI or exposed scripts when the deployment model benefits from taint mode and
  explicit untainting.

### Tests

- Provide tests for generated or modified Perl behavior.
- Prefer `Test::More` for comparing expected and actual values because it gives useful diagnostics.
- Declare an expected test plan when the number of tests is known.
- Use dynamic test planning only when the test count genuinely depends on runtime data.
- Use `Perl::Critic` and `Test::Perl::Critic` as configurable quality gates when the project uses them.
- Treat Perl::Critic policies as project rules, not universal truth; configure them to match the repository style before
  enforcing them.

### Idioms

- Prefer three-argument `open`.
- Do not use `grep` or `map` in void context; use `foreach` when the goal is iteration with side effects.
- Keep regular expressions readable with `/x` or `/xx`, whitespace, and comments when patterns become non-trivial.
- Split very complex matching logic into smaller named checks when that improves maintainability.
- Choose regular-expression delimiters that reduce escaping.
- Do not use `/.../` when another delimiter makes slash-heavy or backslash-heavy patterns clearer.
- Keep compact Perl idioms only when they remain easier to verify than the expanded form.

### Other

- Document public Perl modules, scripts, and interfaces with POD.
- Include purpose, synopsis or usage, public subroutines or methods, diagnostics, configuration, dependencies, known
  limitations, author or contact, and license in POD when applicable.
- Write documentation for common usage before edge cases.
- Keep POD markup, terminology, structure, and tone consistent across the project.
- Prefer named command-line options over fragile positional arguments when a script accepts multiple inputs, outputs, or
  modes.
- Provide both short and long option forms for user-facing scripts when it improves usability.
- Support standard CLI conventions where relevant, including `-` for standard input or output and `--` as the end of
  options.

## PowerShell

### Naming

- Use approved PowerShell verbs from `Get-Verb` in `Verb-Noun` names for public commands, functions, and advanced
  functions.
- Prefer specific singular nouns over generic nouns such as `Item` , `Object` , or `Data` unless the generic noun
  accurately describes the resource.
- Use PascalCase for public functions, parameters, modules, classes, enums, attributes, public fields, and public
  properties.
- Use lowercase for PowerShell keywords and operators.
- Use full command names instead of aliases in maintained scripts.
- Use full parameter names instead of positional shorthand in maintained scripts.
- Prefer established parameter names such as `Path` , `LiteralPath` , `Name` , `InputObject` , `Credential` , `Force` ,
  and `PassThru` when they match the command behavior.
- Use `Path` when wildcard expansion is intended and `LiteralPath` when the input must be interpreted exactly.

### Formatting

- Start maintained scripts and advanced functions with `[CmdletBinding()]` unless there is a clear reason not to.
- Structure advanced functions in execution order: `param`, `begin`, `process`, then `end`.
- Use four spaces per indentation level unless the existing project style requires otherwise.
- Keep lines under 115 characters when practical.
- Prefer splatting, arrays, hashtables, and natural continuation over backtick line continuation.
- Do not leave trailing whitespace.
- Do not use semicolons as routine line terminators.
- Apply PowerShell formatting only to touched PowerShell files unless a project check requires a broader format pass.

### Errors

- Use `-ErrorAction Stop` for cmdlet calls inside `try` blocks when the failure must be caught.
- Set `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'` only within a clear scope and restore the previous value afterward.
- Put the whole transactional operation inside `try` instead of using Boolean flags to infer success.
- Do not use `$?` as structured error handling.
- Capture the current error record immediately at the start of each `catch` block.
- Prefer explicit exceptions, captured error records, and actionable diagnostics over ambiguous status output.

### Safety

- Never hard-code credentials, tokens, passwords, or other secrets in scripts, repositories, logs, or command history.
- Accept credentials through a `[System.Management.Automation.PSCredential]` parameter when a reusable command needs
  credentials.
- Use `SecureString` only for sensitive values and avoid plaintext conversion except at the final required API boundary.
- Treat execution policies as operational controls, not security boundaries.
- Prefer signed scripts in controlled environments when organizational policy requires controlled script execution.
- Validate external input before using it in commands, paths, filters, or script blocks.
- Prefer paths based on `$PSScriptRoot`, `Join-Path`, or resolved absolute paths over unsafe relative paths.

### Tests

- Run `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer` against every generated or modified PowerShell script when PSScriptAnalyzer is installed,
  available, and accessible in the working environment.
- Use the repository's existing PSScriptAnalyzer settings when they exist; do not add or change analyzer settings unless
  the user explicitly requests that configuration change.
- Treat `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer` findings as defects to address unless a finding conflicts with a verified project
  convention or an explicitly documented compatibility requirement.
- Do not suppress, exclude, or bypass PSScriptAnalyzer findings to make PowerShell pass unless the user explicitly
  requests that configuration change.
- If `PSScriptAnalyzer` is not installed, unavailable, or inaccessible, report that limitation and use the best
  available fallback check, such as PowerShell parser validation, a syntax-only run, the project test suite, or the
  target tool's native validation command.
- State that fallback validation does not replace a successful `Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer` run.
- Test pipeline input, validation attributes, error paths, and state-changing commands when they are affected by a
  change.
- Do not claim a PowerShell rule is functionally required when it is only stylistic or taste-based.

### Idioms

- Use `process {}` when accepting pipeline input.
- Output objects to the pipeline from reusable tools instead of formatted text.
- Do not use `return` as the normal output mechanism for reusable functions.
- Add `[OutputType()]` to reusable public functions when they return objects.
- Do not use `Write-Host` for reusable script output unless the command is intentionally display-only or
  host-interactive.
- Use `Write-Verbose`, `Write-Debug`, and `Write-Warning` for optional detail, diagnostics, and warnings.
- Keep each public command output stream coherent; do not interleave unrelated strings, status text, and objects.
- Support `-PassThru` for state-changing commands when returning the changed object should be optional.
- Use `SupportsShouldProcess` for public commands that change state when `-WhatIf` or `-Confirm` support is expected.
- Use strongly typed parameters when the accepted value has a clear type.
- Use `[switch]` for optional true/false command flags.
- Prefer parameter validation attributes over manual validation inside the function body.
- Provide comment-based help for public scripts and functions.
- Keep parameter documentation close to the `param` block when practical.
- Put reusable behavior in modules or function libraries instead of duplicating it across controller scripts.

### Other

- Add PowerShell module structure, logging frameworks, configuration systems, or remoting support only when required by
  the task or existing project context.
- Treat framework-specific guidance for PowerShell Universal, MSP/RMM tools, enterprise hardening, or hosting platforms
  as contextual unless the project explicitly uses those environments.
- Stream large inputs instead of loading everything into memory when incremental processing is feasible.

## Windows Batch

### Naming

- Prefer `.cmd` for new Windows NT-based command scripts unless the project convention requires `.bat`.
- Keep `.bat` only for compatibility, legacy behavior, or consistency with existing project files.
- Avoid spaces in Windows Batch script filenames.
- Avoid script names that collide with built-in commands, common executables, or commands expected to be found through
  `PATH` .
- Use `%~nx0` or `%~n0` when a script must print its own name in usage, help, or diagnostic messages.
- Use local variable names that cannot be confused with system, global, or dynamic environment variables.
- Do not overwrite system, global, or dynamic variables such as `%TEMP%` , `%TMP%` , `%DATE%` , `%TIME%` , `%RANDOM%` ,
  `%ERRORLEVEL%` , `%CD%` , `%PATHEXT%` , or `%COMSPEC%` .
- Use clear constant-style variable names for documented exit codes.

### Formatting

- Start user-facing Windows Batch scripts with `@ECHO OFF`.
- Start non-trivial scripts with `SETLOCAL ENABLEEXTENSIONS` to limit environment side effects and enable command
  processor extensions.
- Enable delayed expansion only when runtime variable expansion inside loops or parenthesized blocks is required.
- Avoid delayed expansion when processing values that may contain exclamation marks unless the script deliberately
  handles them.
- Keep functional script code ASCII-only unless the script explicitly configures and documents code page or Unicode
  handling.
- Write one command per line by default.
- Avoid excessive `&` command chaining.
- Avoid caret line continuations unless they clearly improve readability.
- Indent parenthesized blocks consistently.
- Keep conditionals, loops, and subroutines visually separable with simple spacing.
- Use `REM` for comments that must be safe in all contexts.
- Use `::` only for simple top-level comments.
- Do not use `::` comments inside `FOR` loops or parenthesized blocks.
- Keep user-facing help or usage text concise and reusable when the script accepts options.

### Errors

- Return `0` on success and a non-zero exit code on failure.
- Treat exit codes as part of the script interface.
- Document non-zero exit codes near the top of non-trivial scripts.
- Check critical command failures explicitly.
- For fail-fast behavior, use `command || EXIT /B <code>` or an equivalent checked branch.
- Prefer `EXIT /B` inside scripts and subroutines.
- Do not use plain `EXIT` unless the intention is to close the command processor.
- When checking general failure, prefer explicit non-zero checks over assumptions that every failure code is greater
  than or equal to `1` .
- Use `IF ERRORLEVEL n` with descending thresholds when testing ranges; use `%ERRORLEVEL% NEQ 0` when an exact non-zero
  check is required.
- Write diagnostics and errors to STDERR when normal STDOUT may be consumed by another command.
- Fail clearly when required arguments, files, commands, directories, environment variables, or privileges are missing.
- Do not redirect errors to `NUL` when those errors affect control flow or troubleshooting.

### Safety

- Use `%~dp0` for paths relative to the script location.
- Do not use `%CD%` when the intended base path is the script directory.
- Quote paths, filenames, and variable expansions that may contain spaces or special characters.
- Use `SET "name=value"` for string assignments, especially when values may contain spaces or special characters.
- Do not add spaces around `=` in basic `SET` assignments.
- Avoid storing surrounding quote characters inside variable values unless the value semantically includes quotes.
- Quote variables at the point of use instead of storing surrounding quotes in the variable value.
- Validate command-line arguments before processing them.
- Handle missing arguments explicitly.
- Handle unexpected extra arguments explicitly when the script has a fixed interface.
- Handle empty user input explicitly.
- Validate numeric input before using it in `SET /A` expressions.
- Treat user input, environment variables, command output, and file paths as untrusted until validated.
- Sanitize or constrain paths before passing them to destructive commands such as `DEL` , `RD` , `RMDIR` , or
  `ROBOCOPY /MIR` .
- Do not store credentials, tokens, passwords, API keys, or other secrets in Windows Batch files.
- Do not make automation scripts depend on `PAUSE`.
- Reserve `PAUSE` for manual or demonstration scripts.
- Document required administrator privileges when a script needs elevation.
- Do not silently assume elevation.
- Avoid hidden side effects on the caller environment, current directory, global variables, or external files.

### Tests

- Run Windows Batch scripts from an existing Command Prompt during development so errors and output remain visible.
- For generated or modified scripts, provide a representative `cmd.exe` verification command when execution is
  practical.
- Exercise the supported help or usage option, such as `/?` , `/h` , `-h` , or `--help` , when that path is affected by
  a change.
- Exercise missing argument, invalid argument, missing file, and failure-path behavior when those paths are affected by
  a change.
- Verify scripts that use delayed expansion, parenthesized blocks, redirection, argument forwarding, destructive file
  operations, or subroutines with representative inputs.
- Verify that expected STDOUT, STDERR, log output, and exit codes match the script contract.
- For automation scripts, test execution without interactive prompts.
- For scripts that may need troubleshooting, verify that log files are initialized, overwritten, appended, or
  timestamped according to the intended retention behavior.
- Do not claim a Windows Batch script is production-ready unless quoting, argument validation, error handling, exit
  codes, and verification steps have been addressed.

### Idioms

- Use `%1` through `%9` for positional arguments.
- Use `%0` for the script invocation.
- Use `%*` when forwarding all original arguments.
- Use `SHIFT` when processing more than nine arguments.
- Use `%~1` to remove surrounding quotes from an argument.
- Use `%~f1` , `%~d1` , `%~p1` , `%~n1` , `%~x1` , or related modifiers when path components must be extracted from an
  argument.
- Use `IF NOT DEFINED var` when checking whether a variable is unset.
- Quote both sides of string comparisons when variables may be empty.
- Use direct quoted comparisons only when comparing actual string values.
- Use `IF /I` only when case-insensitive comparison is required.
- Keep comparisons case-sensitive by default.
- Use `IF EXIST` and `IF NOT EXIST` for filesystem checks.
- Use `FOR` for iterating files, directories, values, ranges, and command output.
- Inside batch files, use `%%I` loop variables, not `%I`.
- Use `FOR /F` deliberately when parsing command output or file lines, and document delimiter or token choices when they
  are not obvious.
- Use delayed expansion with `!VAR!` when variables must update at execution time inside parenthesized blocks.
- Use `SET /A` only for arithmetic or numeric assignments.
- Use labels plus `CALL :subroutine` only for reusable subroutines.
- Place subroutines after the main logic.
- Ensure the main logic exits before execution can fall through into subroutines.
- End every subroutine with `EXIT /B <code>`.
- Treat subroutine return values as status codes.
- Use STDOUT, files, or caller-provided variables for returned data.
- Do not use exit codes to return business values or parsed data.
- Redirect STDOUT and STDERR deliberately with `>`, `>>`, `2>`, and `2>&1`.
- Use `NUL` only to suppress expected noise.
- Prefer `ROBOCOPY` over `XCOPY` for robust directory copy operations when the target Windows environment supports it.
- When checking `ROBOCOPY`, treat documented success and partial-success exit codes separately from real failure codes.

### Other

- Use Windows Batch for simple Windows automation, command orchestration, file operations, scheduled task wrappers, and
  low-dependency tasks.
- Prefer PowerShell or another more suitable language for complex logic, typed data handling, object pipelines, REST
  APIs, or larger maintainability needs.
- Prefer simple, explicit Batch control flow over clever command processor tricks.
- Keep labels and `CALL :subroutine` blocks focused on one clear script responsibility.
- Keep user-facing messages concise, actionable, and consistent.
- Do not generalize rules from Azure Batch, Python integration, GUI automation, POSIX shell, Bash, WSL, or other
  non-Command-Prompt ecosystems unless they are directly applicable to Windows Batch scripting.

## PCBoard Programming Language

### Naming

- Use `.PPS` as the default extension for PPL source files.
- Do not use `.PPE` as a source extension; `.PPE` is the compiled executable format produced by PPLC.
- Declare variables before use with a documented PPL type: `BOOLEAN`, `DATE`, `INTEGER`, `MONEY`, `STRING`, or `TIME`.
- Start variable names with a letter, then use only letters, digits, and underscores.
- Do not use spaces, hyphens, punctuation, accented characters, or Unicode characters in identifiers.
- Do not rely on letter case to distinguish variables, labels, keywords, or identifiers.
- Use consistent casing only for readability, because case is significant only inside literal strings.
- Keep variable names meaningfully unique within their first 32 characters to avoid compiler-recognized name collisions.
- Name labels by intent and use them only for localized subroutines or exceptional exits.

### Formatting

- Write PPL source as plain ASCII-compatible text suitable for a DOS-era compiler.
- Avoid Unicode punctuation, smart quotes, non-ASCII operators, invisible characters, and editor-specific formatting.
- Keep physical lines short and readable even though PPL source lines may allow much longer text.
- Prefer one clear statement per line over dense one-line code.
- Use explicit `LET variable = expression` assignments when generating code.
- Use parentheses in non-trivial arithmetic, string, or boolean expressions to make precedence explicit.
- Keep generated examples minimal, complete, and compilable.
- Do not place pseudo-code inside PPL code blocks unless it is clearly marked as pseudo-code.
- Document the intended PCBoard and PPLC versions when generated code depends on version-sensitive syntax, functions, or
  behavior.

### Errors

- Treat PPLC compiler errors as blocking; do not deliver or install a PPE when compilation fails.
- Treat PPLC compiler warnings as defects unless a warning is intentionally accepted and documented.
- When compiling through automation, check PPLC exit status and diagnostics, and distinguish clean success, warnings,
  missing inputs, missing files, and fatal failures when the compiler exposes enough information.
- After file operations such as `FOPEN` , `FCREATE` , `FAPPEND` , `FGET` , or `FPUT` , check `FERR(channel)` when
  failure could affect correctness.
- Close every opened file channel explicitly with `FCLOSE` before returning from the routine that opened it.
- Keep file channel usage within the documented `0` through `7` range.
- Avoid complex channel reuse; a routine that opens a channel should normally close the same channel before returning.
- Do not rely on implicit type conversion for correctness-sensitive business logic.
- Make conversions explicit when mixed expression types could change behavior or readability.

### Safety

- Treat user input, file contents, modem input, display text, and PCBoard environment data as untrusted until validated.
- Use typed input statements, explicit input lengths, valid character masks, and appropriate flags when collecting user
  input.
- Do not accept unrestricted strings when a narrower input format is known.
- Hide passwords and confidential values with `ECHODOTS` or an equivalent supported input flag.
- Do not echo secrets in clear text to the remote or local display.
- Strip PCBoard display or color control sequences, such as `@X` codes, before writing user-facing strings to plain logs
  when those codes are not meaningful.
- Use `STRIPATX()` when PCBoard color/control code removal is required.
- Do not pass user-controlled text into execution paths, PPE launch paths, or display-control contexts that can
  interpret PCBoard control sequences.
- Enforce the required PCBoard command security level at installation time through `CMD.LST` or the conference-specific
  command list.
- Check runtime authorization before executing privileged actions when authorization affects correctness or security.
- For long output, use `STARTDISP` with the appropriate mode and periodically check `ABORT()`.
- When output is aborted, stop printing and call `RESETDISP` before continuing with later display logic.

### Tests

- For any non-trivial PPL change, follow the full lifecycle: write `.PPS` , compile with PPLC, install the generated
  `.PPE` , then test it in the intended PCBoard context.
- Do not treat successful compilation alone as sufficient validation.
- Test the PPE at the exact intended integration point, such as command, script questionnaire, `PCBTEXT` prompt, display
  file, or menu replacement.
- Test file-operation success and failure paths when the PPE opens, creates, appends, reads, or writes files.
- Test user abort behavior for long displays that use `STARTDISP`, `ABORT()`, and `RESETDISP`.
- Test input validation, length limits, masks, and confidential-input behavior when the PPE accepts user input.
- Test command security level and runtime authorization behavior when the PPE performs privileged actions.
- Test generated code against the declared target PCBoard and PPLC versions when compatibility matters.

### Idioms

- Treat PCBoard Programming Language as a PCBoard-specific compiled scripting language, not as generic BASIC, batch, or
  Pascal.
- Prefer PCBoard-native PPEs that customize one clear PCBoard integration point.
- Keep PPEs small, focused, and tied to their intended PCBoard runtime context.
- Match the PPE design to its installation context instead of mixing command, questionnaire, prompt, display-file, and
  menu responsibilities.
- Prefer structured control flow with `IF`/`ELSEIF`/`ELSE`/`ENDIF`, `WHILE`/`ENDWHILE`, and `FOR`/`NEXT`.
- Reserve `GOTO` for exceptional exits, such as leaving deeply nested logic after a critical error.
- Use `GOSUB` and `RETURN` for repeated logic, and ensure every `GOSUB` path reaches a matching `RETURN`.
- Prefer broadly supported PPL primitives for compatibility-oriented code.
- Avoid version-specific functions unless the target PCBoard and PPLC versions are known to support them.

### Other

- State the operational assumptions for every generated PPL/PPE deliverable.
- Include the assumed PCBoard version, PPLC version if known, installation point, expected file paths, required security
  level, file channels used, and ANSI/color-code expectations.
- Do not introduce modern abstractions, dependency managers, package layouts, unit-test frameworks, or security models
  that are not supported by the DOS/PCBoard/PPL environment.
- Explain modern safety concerns separately instead of pretending the original runtime supports modern controls.
- Use secondary sources only for historical or ecosystem context, not as the basis for unsupported technical rules.

## Tcl Eggdrop Scripting

### Naming

- Apply these rules only to Tcl scripts written for Eggdrop bots; do not apply
  them blindly to generic Tcl applications, Eggdrop C modules, or unrelated IRC
  bot frameworks.
- Use a Tcl namespace for non-trivial Eggdrop scripts to avoid collisions with
  Eggdrop globals and with other loaded scripts.
- When a namespace is not practical, prefix script-specific procedures and
  variables with a short, unique script identifier.
- Use clear variable and procedure names that reveal Eggdrop intent, such as the
  bind type, IRC target, configured channel, timer purpose, or permission model.
- Do not rely on naming conventions alone to distinguish strings, lists, arrays,
  dictionaries, or integers; make parsing and data conversion explicit where the
  type affects correctness.
- Avoid generic global procedure or variable names such as `init`, `config`,
  `data`, `user`, or `message` in scripts that may be loaded with other scripts.

### Formatting

- Structure maintained Eggdrop Tcl scripts into clear sections: header, user
  configuration, procedure definitions, bind declarations, and load
  confirmation.
- Include the script name, version, purpose, target Eggdrop version, target Tcl
  version when relevant, and basic usage in the header.
- Keep user-editable settings in one dedicated configuration section near the
  top of classic Tcl scripts.
- For Eggdrop 1.10+ Autoscripts, expose normal user configuration through
  `manifest.json` instead of requiring manual edits to active Tcl code.
- Keep operational code separate from configuration; do not duplicate the same
  configurable value across unrelated code paths.
- Group `bind` declarations so the script behavior can be audited quickly.
- For simple scripts, grouping binds near the top is acceptable when it improves
  readability.
- For larger or riskier scripts, define procedures before registering binds so
  load-time errors are less likely to leave partially active behavior.
- End maintained scripts with a clear `putlog` load message that includes the
  script name and version.

### Errors

- Ensure every `bind` references an existing procedure.
- Ensure every bound procedure uses the exact argument list required by the
  documented Eggdrop bind type.
- Do not invent Eggdrop commands, Tcl commands, bind types, or module-specific
  commands that are not available in the declared target runtime.
- Declare module requirements before using module-specific Eggdrop commands.
- State the minimum Eggdrop and Tcl versions when using version-sensitive
  commands, Autoscript packaging, or behavior that may differ across Eggdrop
  versions.
- Treat load-time failures as operational defects; do not design scripts that
  can silently load with missing procedures, broken binds, or incomplete
  configuration.
- Do not rely on public channel messages for diagnostics; use Eggdrop logging
  commands for runtime visibility.

### Safety

- Prefer the most specific bind that solves the requested behavior.
- Do not use broad message listeners such as `PUBM *` when an exact public
  command bind is sufficient.
- Use Eggdrop bind flags to restrict who may trigger commands whenever the
  access requirement can be expressed with Eggdrop's flag model.
- Do not replace Eggdrop's global, channel, bot, `|`, or `&` flag-mask behavior
  with ad hoc privilege checks unless bind flags cannot express the required
  condition.
- Treat IRC nicknames, idents, hosts, channel names, public messages, private
  messages, topic text, and file contents as untrusted input.
- Do not treat raw IRC text as a Tcl list unless the script intentionally parsed
  it into a Tcl list.
- Use Tcl string commands for raw strings and Tcl list commands only for actual
  Tcl lists.
- Use `putserv` for direct server commands.
- Use `puthelp` for normal channel or user messages.
- Use `putquick` only when faster queued output is justified.
- Avoid `putnow` unless immediate unqueued output is explicitly required,
  because bypassing queues can flood the bot off the IRC server.
- Use `putlog` or `putloglev` for operational diagnostics instead of sending
  debug output to public channels.
- Use `.tcl source script/file.tcl` only in controlled development scenarios
  where `.tcl` is enabled only for trusted users.
- Do not develop or test new scripts directly on important or busy channels.
- When a script creates binds, timers, or persistent state, provide a cleanup
  strategy using `unbind`, `killtimer`, or `killutimer` as appropriate.
- Store timer identifiers returned by `timer` or `utimer` when the timer may
  need to be cancelled later.
- Do not create infinite repeating timers with count `0` unless their lifecycle
  is explicitly managed.

### Tests

- Test new or modified Eggdrop Tcl scripts on a non-critical bot before
  deploying them to active channels.
- Reload classic scripts through the Eggdrop configuration and `.rehash`, or
  restart the bot when the change requires it.
- For controlled development only, verify manual reloads with `.tcl source`
  under restricted access.
- Before presenting generated Eggdrop Tcl code as final, verify that every bind
  has a matching procedure and the correct procedure signature.
- Verify that generated output uses the intended Eggdrop queue: `putserv`,
  `puthelp`, `putquick`, or `putnow`.
- Verify that configurable values are defined once and read consistently.
- Verify that non-trivial scripts use a namespace or a unique script prefix.
- Verify that repeating timers have a defined cancellation or lifecycle
  strategy.
- Verify that the script logs a clear load message with its name and version.
- For Eggdrop 1.10+ Autoscripts, verify that the package contains the Tcl script
  and `manifest.json`, and that the script name, manifest name, and directory
  name are consistent.

### Idioms

- Implement Eggdrop behavior as Tcl procedures triggered by Eggdrop binds.
- Keep bind-specific logic thin; move non-trivial parsing, validation, and
  behavior into named procedures.
- Use `timer` for minute-level scheduling and `utimer` for second-level
  scheduling.
- Use `global` only for variables that are intentionally shared in classic Tcl
  scripts.
- For Autoscripts and namespace-based scripts, prefer Tcl's `variable` command
  over unnecessary `global` statements.
- Keep classic script conventions and Autoscript conventions separate unless
  the target deployment model explicitly requires both.
- Prefer Eggdrop-native commands and documented bind behavior over patterns
  copied from unrelated Tcl or IRC bot frameworks.

### Other

- Prefer official Eggheads or Eggdrop documentation for Eggdrop command and bind
  behavior.
- Use Eggdrop.fr wiki or forum guidance only when it is consistent with
  official Eggdrop documentation.
- Treat existing script repositories, script catalogs, Stack Overflow, Reddit,
  Hacker News, and generic hosting knowledgebase pages as examples or secondary
  context, not as normative sources.
- Do not generalize a rule from one example Eggdrop script into a universal
  coding rule.
- When generating Autoscript packages, include at least the Tcl script and a
  `manifest.json` file.
- Keep script, manifest, and directory names consistent for Autoscript packages.
- Do not require users to edit active code paths for normal configuration.
- Write comments that explain intent, configuration, assumptions, permission
  requirements, queue choices, timer lifecycle, or non-obvious Eggdrop behavior.
- Do not generate comments that merely restate the next Tcl command.

## mIRC Scripting Language

### Naming

- Use clear alias names that describe the command shortcut, reusable routine, or
  custom identifier behavior.
- Define implementation-only aliases with `alias -l` so they remain local to the
  current script file and are not exposed as public commands.
- Use `/var` for routine-local state and reserve variables created with `/set`
  for state that must intentionally survive beyond the current alias, event, or
  script execution.
- Use clear socket names when raw socket handling is required, so each socket's
  lifecycle and event handlers remain easy to audit.

### Formatting

- Keep aliases small, explicit, and focused on one command shortcut, reusable
  routine, or simple custom identifier behavior.
- Do not generate aliases that call themselves recursively.
- Inside script files, omit leading `/` command prefixes unless they improve
  clarity in an example or are required by the surrounding context.
- Use `//` only when command-line identifier evaluation is intentionally
  required, `.` only when a quiet command is intended, and `!` only when alias
  processing must be bypassed.
- Use `;` for line comments and `/* ... */` for block comments.
- Comment non-obvious event triggers, risky commands, identifier evaluation,
  file access, socket handling, and intentional use of `halt`, `goto`, or global
  state.

### Errors

- Validate required alias parameters before using them, using required-parameter
  forms such as `$$1` or explicit guards before commands that depend on user
  input.
- Use positional parameters such as `$1`, `$2`, and `$2-` deliberately and only
  where their meaning is clear at the call site.
- Treat identifiers as runtime expressions that may return `$null`; check for
  `$null` before branching, formatting output, or passing identifier results to
  commands.
- For non-trivial scripts that need recovery or cleanup, define an `:error`
  label, read `$error`, handle the failure, and call `/reseterror` before
  continuing or returning.
- When using file commands, check file access errors with
  `$fopen(<handle>).err`, `$ferr`, or the relevant mIRC file-error identifier
  because file access failures do not necessarily halt execution.
- When using sockets, check `$sockerr` after socket commands and before
  processing socket events.

### Safety

- Keep remote events narrow by using precise levels, match text, and locations.
- Avoid broad catch-all private or channel message handlers unless the behavior
  is intentionally global and documented.
- Do not generate opaque, obfuscated, or unexplained remote scripts; generated
  mIRC scripts must remain readable and reviewable before loading.
- Avoid generating file server or DCC exposure unless explicitly requested.
- If file server behavior is required, restrict the exposed home directory,
  document the risk, and avoid exposing private or confidential files.
- Use raw sockets only for scripts that genuinely need raw network connections;
  do not generate socket code for ordinary IRC automation.
- Close files after use with `/fclose`, and close sockets after use when the
  socket lifecycle is complete.
- Avoid unintended double evaluation when assigning literal expression-like
  content; use non-evaluating forms such as `/set -n` or `/var -n` when the
  value must remain literal.

### Tests

- Verify generated mIRC scripts against the official mIRC Help behavior for the
  commands, identifiers, events, file handling, hash tables, sockets, and script
  features used.
- Test aliases with missing, empty, and multi-word parameters when positional
  parameters, required parameters, or `$2-` are used.
- Test `$null` results from identifiers before approving branches or output that
  depends on identifier values.
- Test file access success and failure paths, including cleanup paths that must
  call `/fclose`.
- Test socket success and failure paths when socket code is generated, including
  `$sockerr` handling and socket closure.
- Verify that remote event handlers match only the intended levels, text, and
  locations.
- Verify that generated hash-table logic does not depend on item storage, save,
  or load order.

### Idioms

- Prefer structured control flow with `if`, `elseif`, `else`, `while`, `break`,
  and `continue` for normal logic.
- Avoid `goto` except for simple, clearly bounded labels where structured flow
  would be less clear; document every intentional `goto` use.
- Use `/return [value]` when an alias or custom identifier must return a value
  to its caller through `$result`.
- Use `/halt` only when the intended behavior is to stop the current script and
  prevent further processing.
- Use hash tables for large keyed data that needs efficient storage and lookup,
  but never rely on hash table item order.
- Use `$calc()` for intentionally complex calculations.
- Enable big-float calculations only for scripts that require very large numeric
  calculations, because big-float calculations are slower than normal
  calculations.

### Other

- Treat official mIRC Help semantics as the primary source of truth for mIRC
  scripting behavior.
- Do not treat editor completion files, autocomplete snippets, historical
  articles, forums, or examples as authoritative language specifications.
- Use autocomplete data only as editor-support context for discovering possible
  command names or parameters, never as a replacement for official mIRC
  documentation.

## GW-BASIC

### Naming

- Do not use GW-BASIC reserved words as variable names.
- Start variable names with a letter.
- Use only letters, digits, and the decimal point in variable names before any
  type declaration character.
- Keep variable names meaningfully unique within the first 40 characters,
  because GW-BASIC recognizes only that significant part.
- Put any type declaration character at the end of the variable name.
- Use explicit type suffixes when type clarity matters.
- Use `$` for string variables, `%` for integer variables, `!` for
  single-precision variables, and `#` for double-precision variables.
- Avoid unnecessary double precision because it uses more memory and calculation
  time.
- Keep variable and expression types compatible.
- Do not assign numeric values to string variables.
- Do not assign string values to numeric variables unless an explicit conversion
  is intended.

### Formatting

- Every stored GW-BASIC program line must start with a valid line number.
- Use line numbers in ascending logical order and keep them within the valid
  GW-BASIC range.
- Prefer line-number increments of `10`, such as `10`, `20`, and `30`, to leave
  insertion space for later edits.
- Use `RENUM` when line numbering becomes hard to maintain.
- Keep each logical line short enough to remain readable and maintainable.
- Avoid packing unrelated logic on one line.
- Use `:` to combine statements only when the resulting line remains easy to
  read, test, and renumber.
- Use indirect mode for persistent programs.
- Use direct mode only for quick calculations, experiments, or debugging
  commands that do not need to be stored.
- Prefer direct assignment with `variable = expression` instead of
  `LET variable = expression`, unless compatibility with older BASIC dialects is
  explicitly required.
- Use `REM` or apostrophe comments to explain intent.
- Use standalone `REM` lines for section headers or longer notes.
- Use apostrophe comments only for short end-of-line explanations.
- Comment non-obvious formulas, hardware assumptions, file layouts, and error
  handlers.
- Do not place `REM` inside a `DATA` statement, because it is treated as data
  rather than as a comment.
- Keep comments synchronized with the code they describe.
- Remove misleading comments when changing the associated logic.

### Errors

- Use `ON ERROR GOTO lineNumber` around file I/O, device I/O, conversions, and
  other recoverable operations.
- Ensure every error-handler target line exists.
- Keep error handlers short and readable.
- Use `ERR` to identify the error code inside error handlers.
- Use `ERL` to identify the failing line number inside error handlers.
- Recover with `RESUME` or `RESUME NEXT` only when continuing execution is safe.
- Use `ON ERROR GOTO 0` when intentional error trapping should be disabled.
- Avoid code paths that can trigger new errors inside an error handler.
- Ensure every reachable `GOSUB` path returns with `RETURN`.
- Validate that the number of `READ` operations matches the available `DATA`
  values.

### Safety

- Use explicit `OPEN` modes for file I/O.
- Keep file-number usage consistent.
- Document file-number assignments when more than one file or device is used.
- Always `CLOSE` files or devices when the program no longer needs them.
- Use `CLOSE` without a file number only when closing all open files and devices
  is intentional.
- When using record files, ensure that the selected record length is compatible
  with the runtime configuration.
- Document redirected input or output requirements in the program header or
  execution notes.
- Treat printer, serial, joystick, and other device-specific behavior as
  environment-dependent.
- Avoid `PEEK`, `POKE`, `DEF SEG`, `CALL`, `USR`, `INP`, and `OUT` unless
  low-level access is explicitly required.
- Isolate hardware-specific or memory-specific logic in clearly labeled blocks.
- Document memory addresses, port numbers, expected machine state, and emulator
  assumptions.
- Do not assume that behavior from historical DOS hardware will work unchanged
  in modern environments.
- Treat emulator behavior as an implementation detail unless the target emulator
  is explicitly part of the requirements.

### Tests

- Before modifying an existing GW-BASIC program, list and inspect the relevant
  line range.
- After structural edits, verify that all referenced target lines still exist.
- Run the program after each meaningful change when execution is possible.
- Inspect the affected output before continuing to the next change.
- Use deterministic random sequences intentionally when repeatable behavior is
  required for testing.
- Document whether random behavior is expected to be repeatable or
  non-repeatable.

### Idioms

- Use `DIM` explicitly for arrays whose subscript can exceed the default
  implicit bound.
- Do not rely on implicit array allocation for non-trivial arrays.
- Document whether arrays are zero-based or one-based.
- Use `OPTION BASE` only when changing the default array base is intentional and
  documented.
- Keep array dimensions simple.
- Avoid high-dimensional arrays unless the data model clearly requires them.
- Prefer simple array layouts that can be inspected and debugged manually.
- Prefer `FOR...NEXT` loops for counted iteration.
- Prefer `WHILE...WEND` loops for condition-based iteration.
- Use `GOTO` only for simple top-level flow or legacy-compatible control paths
  where a structured alternative would be less readable.
- Use `GOSUB...RETURN` for reusable subroutines.
- Clearly document the input variables expected by each `GOSUB` block.
- Clearly document the output variables modified by each `GOSUB` block.
- Use `DEF FN` only for short single-expression functions.
- Do not use `DEF FN` as a substitute for multi-statement procedures.
- Keep `DATA` statements close to the logic that reads them when practical.
- Use `READ` and `RESTORE` deliberately.
- Document the expected order and meaning of values stored in `DATA`
  statements.
- Avoid mixing unrelated data structures in the same `DATA` block.
- Use `RANDOMIZE TIMER` at the beginning of programs that require
  non-repeatable random sequences.
- Avoid `RANDOMIZE` without an argument in automated programs unless interactive
  seed input is intended.

### Other

- Do not reuse an existing line number unless replacing that line is
  intentional.
- Do not enter a bare existing line number unless deleting that line is
  intentional.
- Use `RENUM` only when it improves maintainability.
- Save the program before exiting GW-BASIC or returning to DOS.

## Rust

### Naming

- Use idiomatic Rust naming consistently: `snake_case` for functions, methods, variables, and modules; `UpperCamelCase`
  for types, traits, and enum variants; and `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for constants and statics.
- Follow Rust API naming conventions for conversions, getters, iterator methods, and Cargo feature names.
- Choose names that make call sites predictable and do not encode implementation details that callers should not depend
  on.
- Use `const` items for repeated values, domain-significant values, thresholds, and limits; use `static` only when a
  stable memory location or intentional global state is required.
- Document non-obvious Rust constants and magic values with the invariant or domain reason they represent, not with a
  restatement of their value.
- Name Rust tests after the behavior they protect instead of naming them only after issue numbers or bug IDs.

### Formatting

- Format Rust code with `cargo fmt` or `rustfmt` before presenting or committing it.
- Keep function signatures explicit: declare parameter types and prefer narrow signatures that expose the real contract
  of the function.
- Prefer immutable bindings by default; add `mut` only when reassignment is intentional and clearer than creating a new
  binding.
- Use shadowing when transforming a value into a new immutable value, especially when the type changes.
- Use Rust expression semantics intentionally: do not add a semicolon to the final expression when the value must be
  returned.
- Prefer implicit final-expression returns for simple functions, and use `return` only when early exit improves clarity.
- Keep Rust comments focused on ownership invariants, safety reasoning, platform behavior, public API contracts, or
  business rules that the type system and names cannot express.
- Do not write comments that merely restate obvious Rust syntax or repeat identifier names.
- When modifying existing Rust code, change only the lines required by the requested behavior and preserve the local
  style.
- Remove only unused imports, variables, functions, feature gates, or Cargo dependencies made unused by the current Rust
  change.

### Errors

- Use `Result<T, E>` for recoverable failures that the caller can handle.
- Use `?` to propagate recoverable errors when it keeps control flow clear.
- Use `Option<T>` only when a value may legitimately be absent and absence is not an error.
- Use `Result<T, E>` instead of `Option<T>` when absence or failure needs an explanation or caller action.
- Avoid `unwrap()` and `expect()` in production paths unless the invariant is truly impossible to violate.
- When `expect()` is justified, write a message that explains the invariant being relied on.
- Use `panic!` for tests, unrecoverable programming bugs, violated invariants, or impossible states.
- Do not use `panic!` as a normal upstream error channel.
- For libraries, expose meaningful error types that provide useful `Display` output and implement the expected traits.
- For applications, broader executable-boundary error wrappers are acceptable when callers are not expected to branch on
  library-level error variants.
- Do not make callers depend on formatting details of human-readable error messages when a typed error would be more
  stable.

### Safety

- Design Rust code around ownership and borrowing instead of working around the borrow checker.
- Keep scopes tight so borrows expire as soon as possible.
- Avoid unnecessary `clone()` calls when borrowing, moving, or restructuring ownership is clearer and sufficient.
- Prefer strong domain types such as newtypes, enums, and structs over ambiguous `bool` , `Option` , string, or numeric
  parameters.
- Return values directly instead of mutating caller-provided out-parameters.
- Use tuples, structs, enums, or custom result types when multiple values must be returned.
- Do not expose dependency-specific types in public APIs unless the dependency is intentionally part of the public
  contract.
- Prefer stable domain types at API boundaries when the dependency is an implementation detail.
- Avoid surprising operator overloads.
- Implement `Deref` only for smart-pointer-like types where dereference behavior is expected by callers.
- Derive or implement `Debug` , `Clone` , `Copy` , `Eq` , `PartialEq` , `Ord` , `PartialOrd` , `Hash` , `Default` , and
  `Display` only when their semantics are correct for the type.
- Ensure all public types implement `Debug` unless there is a specific documented reason not to.
- If a public type contains secrets or sensitive data, implement `Debug` manually and verify that sensitive values are
  redacted.
- Prefer structured logging with named fields when the logging API supports it.
- Never log plain secrets, personal data, tokens, or sensitive file paths.
- Avoid `unsafe` code by default.
- Use `unsafe` only for a valid reason such as FFI, platform calls, low-level abstractions, or measured performance
  work.
- Do not use `unsafe` to bypass lifetimes, `Send` bounds, or ordinary type-system constraints.
- Every unsafe block or unsafe abstraction must include plain-text safety reasoning that states the invariants the code
  relies on.
- If an abstraction cannot be soundly encapsulated as safe Rust, expose an unsafe API instead of pretending it is safe.

### Tests

- Use `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy`, `cargo test`, and compiler lints as standard Rust verification gates.
- Run the narrowest meaningful Rust verification command first, then broaden checks when the change can affect shared
  behavior.
- Use `cargo audit` , `cargo hack` , `cargo udeps` , or Miri when those tools are available and dependency risk, feature
  combinations, unused dependencies, or unsafe-code assumptions are relevant.
- Prefer `#[expect(..., reason = "...")]` over broad `#[allow(...)]` in handwritten code when the project's Rust
  toolchain supports it.
- Reserve broad `#[allow(...)]` usage for generated code, macros, or cases where `expect` is not appropriate.
- Write unit tests, doc tests, and integration tests according to the behavior being protected.
- Keep Rust tests minimal, reproducible, clearly named, and focused on observable behavior.
- Test recoverable error paths, invalid inputs, boundary cases, and invariants that callers rely on.
- Do not accept flaky tests as normal; make tests deterministic or document any platform-specific ignore or requirement
  directive.
- Remove unrelated syntax, unused features, distracting setup, and non-critical failures from tests.
- Reference issue numbers in test comments when useful, but keep the test name semantic.
- Validate unsafe code with focused tests, adversarial cases where relevant, and Miri when applicable.
- Justify unsafe performance work with benchmarks.
- Profile and benchmark before adding performance-motivated complexity.

### Idioms

- Prefer idiomatic Rust APIs, strong types, clear ownership, and testable boundaries.
- Use static inherent constructors such as `Type::new()` for normal construction.
- Implement `Default` only when there is a clear and unsurprising default state.
- Use a builder when construction requires many optional parameters, ordered configuration, or validation before
  instantiation.
- Do not introduce a builder for simple values that can be constructed clearly with `new` , struct literals, or
  `Default` .
- Keep conversions on the most specific type involved.
- Use iterator conventions consistently: expose `iter` , `iter_mut` , and `into_iter` where they match the collection
  behavior.
- Implement `FromIterator` and `Extend` for collection types when that behavior is natural.
- Keep Cargo features additive: features should add capabilities without disabling existing behavior or creating
  incompatible combinations.
- Validate important Cargo feature combinations when the project exposes multiple features.
- Do not optimize by guesswork; identify hot paths, measure them, and document performance-sensitive decisions.
- In performance-sensitive code, watch for repeated string allocation, redundant cloning, repeated hashing, and
  avoidable collection growth.
- Optimize allocation, cloning, hashing, or collection growth only when measurement shows the path matters.
- Design long-running CPU-heavy async work to yield or batch work so it does not starve unrelated tasks.
- Use runtime-specific async budget APIs only when the selected runtime supports them and the need is clear.

### Other

- Document crate-level behavior, modules, public items, examples, errors, panics, and safety requirements for public
  APIs.
- Prefer directly usable documentation examples and use `?` instead of `unwrap()` in normal examples.
- Keep `Cargo.toml` metadata complete for published libraries, including description, license, repository,
  documentation, keywords, and categories when applicable.
- Avoid wildcard dependency versions.
- Treat Cargo features, public error types, public dependency types, and trait implementations as part of the public API
  contract when they affect downstream users.
- Favor idiomatic Rust APIs, strong types, rustdoc examples, explicit unsafe invariants, and Cargo-based verification
  gates.
- Do not introduce new Rust abstractions, builders, feature flags, dependencies, unsafe code, or performance
  optimizations unless they solve the requested Rust problem.

## Docker Files

Apply this section to Dockerfiles and `.dockerignore` files. Do not apply it to
Docker Compose files, Kubernetes manifests, CI workflows, deployment scripts, or
broader runtime infrastructure unless the user explicitly requests that broader
scope. When `RUN` instructions contain substantial shell code, apply the
relevant shell section to that embedded shell logic while keeping Dockerfile
layering, build context, and image-runtime concerns in this section.

### Naming

- Use clear Docker build stage names that describe their role, such as
  `builder`, `test`, or `runtime`.
- When a Dockerfile exposes multiple build targets, name each target after the
  image concern or build role it represents.
- Use consistent names for runtime users, groups, application directories, and
  label keys when those names are introduced by the Dockerfile.

### Formatting

- Generate Dockerfiles only for image build logic; do not use Dockerfiles as CI
  scripts, deployment scripts, database migration runners, or generic shell
  automation wrappers.
- Keep Dockerfile build steps local, deterministic, and limited to producing the
  image filesystem.
- Order instructions from least frequently changing to most frequently changing.
- Copy dependency manifests before copying application source code so dependency
  layers stay cached when only source files change.
- Copy only the files required by each build step.
- Avoid broad `COPY . .` instructions before dependency installation when a
  smaller manifest-only copy can preserve build cache efficiency.
- Combine related package installation and cleanup commands in the same `RUN`
  instruction when doing so reduces image size without harming readability.
- Do not split package-manager update, install, and cleanup steps into separate
  layers when the cleanup is required to keep the image small.
- Clean package-manager caches, temporary files, and build-only artifacts in the
  same layer where they are created.
- Use a `.dockerignore` file to exclude files that are not required for the
  image build, such as VCS metadata, local dependencies, build artifacts, logs,
  documentation, test outputs, and local secrets.
- Keep test stages separate from runtime stages.
- Use `COPY --from=<stage>` to copy artifacts from earlier stages instead of
  rebuilding or reinstalling them in the final image.
- Use `COPY --chown=<user>:<group>` or an equivalent ownership strategy when
  files must be owned by a non-root runtime user.
- Keep production runtime stages focused on runtime execution only.

### Errors

- Treat Dockerfile syntax errors and failed image builds as blocking defects.
- Treat failing test stages as build failures.
- Do not mark a Dockerfile target as valid until that target builds
  successfully in a clean environment.
- Treat known critical vulnerabilities, leaked secrets, and Dockerfile policy
  violations as image publication blockers before publishing an image.
- Treat an unverifiable direct download as a defect when the Dockerfile depends
  on that downloaded artifact.
- Treat a health check as defective when it is expensive, nondeterministic,
  depends on unrelated external systems, or does not represent the image's
  actual local health signal.

### Safety

- Prefer trusted, maintained, technology-specific base images when they match
  the application stack and security requirements.
- Avoid building from a generic operating-system image when an appropriate
  maintained runtime image exists.
- Choose the smallest compatible base image, but do not select Alpine, scratch,
  slim, or distroless images blindly.
- Verify base image compatibility with the runtime, native libraries, debugging
  needs, and security scanning requirements before adopting a minimal image.
- Do not use `latest` tags for production images.
- Use an explicit production image versioning policy, such as pinned tags or
  digests for reproducibility combined with scheduled rebuilds and vulnerability
  scans for security updates.
- Keep production images free of source code, compilers, test frameworks,
  scanners, package managers, and development-only tools unless they are
  explicitly required at runtime.
- Install only packages required by the application.
- Do not add debugging tools, editors, shells, package managers, or network
  tools to production images unless there is an explicit runtime requirement.
- Prefer package managers and trusted repositories for dependencies.
- Avoid `curl | sh`, unverified downloads, and ad hoc binary copies.
- When direct downloads are unavoidable, use HTTPS and verify checksums or
  signatures.
- Pin application dependencies and system packages according to the project
  reproducibility policy.
- Avoid broad `upgrade all` commands in Dockerfiles because they reduce
  reproducibility and make future builds harder to audit.
- Never hardcode secrets, tokens, certificates, SSH keys, database credentials,
  or private endpoints in a Dockerfile, image layer, copied file, `ARG`, or
  `ENV`.
- Inject secrets at runtime through a secrets manager or orchestrator mechanism.
- Use `ARG` only for non-secret build-time values such as build metadata, tool
  versions, target platforms, or feature flags.
- Do not use `ARG` as a secret-passing mechanism because build history and
  intermediate layers may expose values.
- Use `ENV` only for safe default runtime configuration.
- Document required environment variables while keeping sensitive values outside
  the image.
- Do not run production containers as root by default.
- Create or select a non-root user and switch to it with `USER` before the final
  `ENTRYPOINT` or `CMD`.
- Ensure the non-root user can read application files and write only to the
  directories required at runtime.
- Adjust ownership and permissions during the build instead of requiring
  privileged startup scripts.
- Do not rely on root-owned application files unless the runtime explicitly
  requires them.
- Do not design a Dockerfile that requires privileged containers, host Docker
  socket access, or broad Linux capabilities unless the requirement is explicit,
  documented, and reviewed as a security exception.

### Tests

- Build every Dockerfile target that is intended for use.
- When a Dockerfile includes a test stage, build the test stage and make test
  failures fail the build.
- Verify that test-only dependencies and test artifacts are not included in the
  final runtime image unless they are explicitly required at runtime.
- Run Dockerfile linting before publishing or accepting Dockerfile changes when
  a linter is available.
- Run image vulnerability scanning before publishing production images when a
  scanner is available.
- Verify the final image size, runtime user, exposed ports, entrypoint, health
  check, installed packages, and absence of secrets before marking the image as
  production-ready.
- Verify that the `.dockerignore` file excludes unnecessary build-context files
  without excluding files required by the build.

### Idioms

- Prefer one clear runtime concern per image.
- Do not combine unrelated services into one container image when they should be
  separate services or containers.
- Use multi-stage builds whenever build tools, compilers, package managers, test
  dependencies, or source files are not needed in the final runtime image.
- Keep the final stage limited to built artifacts and required runtime files.
- Use `COPY` by default.
- Use `ADD` only when its specific behavior is required, such as intentional
  local archive extraction, and document why `ADD` is necessary.
- Use BuildKit cache mounts for dependency caches when BuildKit is available for
  the target builder and they improve repeatable build performance without
  leaking runtime dependencies into the final image.
- Use BuildKit bind mounts for build-only source access when BuildKit is
  available for the target builder and files are needed temporarily during a
  build step.
- Prefer exec-form `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` so the main process receives signals
  correctly.
- Avoid shell-form `ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD` unless shell expansion is explicitly
  required.
- Use `ENTRYPOINT` for the executable when the image has a fixed primary
  command.
- Use `CMD` for default arguments that users may override.
- Add a `HEALTHCHECK` only when the image exposes a reliable local health
  signal.
- Keep health checks lightweight, deterministic, and scoped to the image's
  actual health.

### Other

- Add useful `LABEL` metadata for ownership, source repository, version,
  license, build revision, and image publication information when the project
  requires traceability.
- Keep Dockerfiles in version control and review Dockerfile changes through the
  same code-review process as application and deployment changes.
- Run Dockerfile linting and image scanning in CI before publishing images when
  the project has CI coverage for container images.
- Prefer official Docker documentation, Dockerfile reference material, and
  maintained image documentation over generic blog posts, forums, social media
  discussions, or video content.
- Do not expand a Dockerfile change into CI, deployment, orchestration, or
  runtime infrastructure changes unless the user explicitly requests that
  broader scope.

## Warez Release NFO File

### Naming

- Use `.nfo` as the filename extension for NFO-style plain-text release
  information artifacts.
- Keep generated NFO-adjacent filenames portable across common filesystems.
- Avoid spaces in generated NFO-adjacent filenames; use dots, underscores, or
  hyphens consistently instead.
- Use a stable, readable release title format and preserve the full title in
  metadata or notes when the filename or displayed title must be shortened.
- Do not invent release names, group names, release dates, versions, sources,
  provenance, affiliations, or status claims.
- Do not impersonate real Warez groups, topsites, couriers, site operators,
  affiliates, or Scene actors.
- Use fictional group tags only when the user explicitly requests a fictional or
  aesthetic NFO and the tag cannot be mistaken for a real group.
- Do not use Scene-specific tags such as `PROPER`, `REPACK`, `FIX`, `INTERNAL`,
  or `READNFO` unless their meaning is explained safely and lawfully.
- When a language tag is used, state the language clearly in the NFO metadata.

### Formatting

- Treat a Warez Release NFO File as a fixed-width plain-text information file,
  not as executable code or markup.
- Assume a monospaced display for every visual element, table, divider, and
  ASCII-art block.
- Keep the NFO readable in a plain text viewer without relying on colors,
  images, proportional fonts, CSS, HTML, Markdown rendering, or
  terminal-specific effects.
- Prefer 7-bit ASCII when maximum portability is required.
- Use CP437-compatible extended characters only when the target renderer,
  archive, or display context explicitly supports them.
- Do not mix incompatible encodings in the same NFO file.
- Use spaces, not tabs, for alignment.
- Preserve intentional interior spacing inside ASCII art and fixed-width tables.
- Do not leave trailing whitespace at line ends.
- Keep each generated NFO line at or below the configured width limit; use 80
  columns when no narrower project limit is provided.
- Split long titles, release names, source references, URLs, and metadata values
  across multiple aligned lines instead of exceeding the width limit.
- Use consistent horizontal separators, section boxes, indentation, and blank
  lines across the generated NFO.
- Keep ASCII art compact enough to fit within the width limit and avoid dense
  decorative blocks that hide the release information.
- Do not prioritize ASCII art over readability of the core metadata and notes.
- Use a stable section order: header, title or release name, release metadata,
  description or notes, lawful technical or compatibility information, lawful
  proof or source references, authorized or fictional credits, then any useful
  legal or safety note.
- Do not include a section when it would contain speculative, unsafe, private,
  or unavailable information.
- Use short section names that remain readable in fixed-width output.
- Do not duplicate the same metadata in multiple sections unless duplication
  improves human readability.

### Errors

- Treat missing required lawful context as a blocking issue only when it would
  make safe generation impossible.
- When metadata is incomplete but safe generation remains possible, omit the
  unknown field or use `Unknown` or `N/A` consistently.
- Reject or rewrite any request for operational piracy instructions, access to
  pirated material, cracking, DRM bypass, credential misuse, unauthorized
  distribution, or private Scene infrastructure details.
- If the user asks for a real operational piracy NFO, refuse the operational
  content and offer a safe historical, fictional, archival, educational, or
  legitimate-release alternative.
- Treat encoding mismatches, line-width overflow, broken alignment, tabs,
  trailing spaces, unsafe operational content, and private identifiers as
  defects to fix before finalizing an NFO.
- Treat misleading historical authenticity, invented provenance, fake credits,
  or unauthorized real group signatures as defects.

### Safety

- Generate NFO-style content only for lawful, fictional, archival, documentary,
  educational, or legitimate release-note use.
- Do not generate instructions that enable copyright infringement, cracking,
  DRM bypass, credential misuse, unauthorized distribution, or access to
  pirated material.
- Do not include serial numbers, activation bypasses, keygen instructions, crack
  usage steps, private download links, private server names, credentials, IP
  addresses, invite paths, or operational piracy details.
- Do not include real nicknames, identities, site operators, affiliates,
  private group members, or identifying metadata unless the user provides
  explicit, lawful, publication-ready material.
- Do not add Scene-specific claims of precedence, private access, affiliation,
  status, supply-chain position, or release authority unless the file is
  explicitly fictional or based on lawful historical quotation.
- Do not browse for pirated material, release databases, cracks, serials,
  private Scene sources, download paths, or other operational piracy resources.
- Do not use offensive, hateful, sexually explicit, or targeted abusive ASCII
  art.
- Do not copy protected ASCII artwork from real groups unless the user provides
  authorization or the use is clearly lawful historical quotation within
  applicable limits.
- When uncertainty remains, prioritize safety, legality, readability, and
  maintainability over Scene authenticity.

### Tests

- Validate that every generated NFO line respects the configured width limit.
- Validate that ASCII art, tables, separators, and aligned metadata remain
  aligned after saving and reopening the file in a monospaced plain-text viewer.
- Validate CP437 or extended ASCII output in a compatible viewer before treating
  the NFO as final.
- Validate that the raw NFO contains no tabs and no trailing spaces.
- Validate that metadata values are internally consistent and that unknown
  values are omitted or represented consistently.
- Validate that no unsafe operational piracy content is present.
- Validate that no real private identifiers, credentials, IP addresses,
  download paths, invite paths, or personal data are present.
- Validate that the NFO can be read as plain text without special tooling.
- Validate that Markdown, HTML, ANSI escape sequences, or terminal rendering
  syntax has not been mixed into the raw NFO unless explicitly required.
- When a request includes a companion `FILE_ID.DIZ`, validate that sidecar under
  the Warez Release FILE_ID.DIZ section instead of using NFO layout constraints.

### Idioms

- Use an NFO for readable release information, metadata, and longer notes.
- Treat a companion `FILE_ID.DIZ` as a separate archive description governed by
  the Warez Release FILE_ID.DIZ section.
- Do not copy the full NFO body into a `FILE_ID.DIZ` file.
- Use concise, human-readable labels such as `Title`, `Version`, `Date`,
  `Language`, `Platform`, `Format`, `Notes`, and `Source`.
- Prefer direct, readable language over excessive leetspeak or deliberately
  misspelled text.
- Use stylized capitalization only when the meaning remains obvious.
- Avoid unexplained Scene jargon when writing for a general audience.
- Define necessary jargon briefly inside the NFO or in the surrounding
  documentation.
- Use ASCII art only as a header, logo, divider, or signature that supports the
  information layout.
- For historical sources, summarize structure and aesthetics rather than
  reproducing operational release instructions.

### Other

- Apply this section only to `.nfo` files or explicitly NFO-style fixed-width
  plain-text artifacts.
- When working on `FILE_ID.DIZ` or `.diz` artifacts, apply the Warez Release
  FILE_ID.DIZ section instead for DIZ-specific constraints.
- Do not apply this section to Markdown changelogs, README files, ordinary
  project release notes, or non-NFO plain-text documentation.
- Ask for missing metadata only when the missing information blocks safe and
  useful generation.
- If a real-world release is requested, ensure the release is lawful or reframe
  the artifact as a fictional, archival, educational, or legitimate software or
  media release note.
- Do not infer hidden Scene affiliations, release provenance, private access, or
  historical authenticity from style alone.
- When the user requests a downloadable NFO, generate only the safe plain-text
  NFO-style artifact and keep unsafe operational material out of the file.

## Warez Release FILE_ID.DIZ

### Naming

- Use `FILE_ID.DIZ` as the canonical uppercase filename for DIZ archive
  description files.
- Treat `FILE_ID.DIZ` as a short plain-text archive description artifact, not
  as executable code, script output, markup, or a full release note.
- Name and describe only the actual lawful package being summarized.
- Do not invent package titles, versions, disk counts, release categories,
  provenance, group names, affiliations, or compatibility claims.
- Identify the current disk or volume and the total disk or volume count when
  the active profile requires multi-volume metadata.
- Do not assume that every Scene-style or archive package requires a
  `FILE_ID.DIZ`; apply the active category or packaging rules first.

### Formatting

- Treat a DIZ as fixed-width plain text intended for archive and BBS-style
  description workflows.
- Use the default BBS-compatible profile when no more specific DIZ profile is
  provided.
- For the default BBS-compatible profile, use plain ASCII text, at most 10
  lines, at most 45 characters per line, and no blank lines.
- For the default BBS-compatible profile, do not center text and do not use
  Markdown, HTML, ANSI escape sequences, or rich formatting.
- For the default BBS-compatible profile, make the first two lines
  self-contained because older BBS software may truncate descriptions.
- Use the Scene 0day ZIP+DIZ profile only when the active ruleset explicitly
  follows the historical ZIP+DIZ packaging model.
- For the Scene 0day ZIP+DIZ profile, include a DIZ file in each ZIP, include a
  concrete current-disk and total-disk marker, limit the file to 30 lines, and
  limit each line to 45 characters.
- Use `[xx/??]` only as a template marker form; finalized DIZ files must replace
  both placeholders with concrete values.
- Use the Scene eBook profile only for an eBook ruleset or another explicitly
  compatible ruleset.
- For the Scene eBook profile, include a valid `.diz` file, include a concrete
  disk count line such as `DISK: [01/03]`, limit width to 44 characters, and
  limit height to 30 lines.
- Keep `.diz` and `.nfo` files inside ZIP archives when the active ZIP+DIZ
  packaging profile requires archive-embedded metadata.
- Treat historical DIZ and NFO dimensions as compatibility recommendations
  unless the active ruleset makes them mandatory.
- Use the Scene-art compatibility profile only when the user explicitly requests
  Scene-style ASCII or ANSI-art aesthetics.
- For Scene-art DIZ output, preserve readability in a plain-text viewer, keep
  required metadata visible, and validate line width against the intended
  rendered width rather than only Unicode code-point count.
- Use CP437-compatible text art only when the target renderer is known.
- Do not apply Scene-art conventions to strict BBS-compatible DIZ output.
- Keep DIZ content concise; place detailed release notes, changelog entries,
  license text, and long documentation in an NFO, README, changelog, or license
  artifact instead.
- Hard-wrap every generated line before the active profile width limit.
- Do not emit trailing spaces, tab characters, or control characters other than
  normal line breaks.
- Do not emit empty lines in strict BBS-compatible output.

### Errors

- Fail closed when the target DIZ profile, disk count, width limit, or required
  archive placement is unknown and cannot be inferred safely.
- Reject a finalized DIZ that still contains unresolved template placeholders
  such as `[xx/??]` or `DISK: [xx/??]`.
- Treat line-width overflow, excessive line count, broken disk markers, tabs,
  trailing spaces, forbidden control characters, and unexpected blank lines as
  defects to fix before finalizing a DIZ.
- Treat Markdown syntax, HTML markup, ANSI escape sequences, rich formatting, or
  incompatible encodings as defects unless the active profile explicitly permits
  them.
- If a modern ruleset does not list DIZ as an allowed final artifact, do not
  generate a DIZ unless the user explicitly requests a lawful archival or
  compatibility sidecar outside that release profile.
- Reject or rewrite requests that would make the DIZ contain operational piracy
  material, private infrastructure details, credentials, cracking information,
  DRM-bypass guidance, keygens, serials, or unauthorized distribution details.
- Do not hide detailed release information inside a DIZ when the active profile
  expects only a compact archive description.

### Safety

- Generate DIZ metadata only for lawful, archival, shareware, demo,
  preservation, fictional, educational, or rights-cleared packages.
- Do not generate cracks, keygens, serials, DRM-bypass instructions, credential
  material, distribution automation, or operational piracy guidance.
- Do not include site names, IP addresses, credentials, private contacts,
  private distribution paths, invite details, or infrastructure hints.
- Keep descriptions short, factual, package-specific, and limited to information
  useful for quick archive identification.
- Avoid unverifiable claims, promotional filler, excessive slogans, private
  operational details, and misleading authenticity signals.
- Do not generalize 0day, eBook, music, game ISO, BBS, or Scene-art rules across
  unrelated release categories.
- When uncertainty remains, prioritize legality, safety, compatibility,
  readability, and machine-checkable metadata over Scene authenticity.

### Tests

- Before presenting a generated DIZ as usable, report the selected DIZ profile,
  maximum line count, maximum width, allowed character set, required disk marker,
  and archive placement rule.
- Validate the generated DIZ after rendering and wrapping, not only before
  wrapping.
- Validate that every line respects the active width limit and that total height
  respects the active line-count limit.
- Validate that required disk or volume markers are present, concrete, correctly
  formatted, and internally consistent.
- Validate that the raw DIZ contains no trailing spaces, tabs, forbidden control
  characters, or forbidden empty lines.
- Validate that Markdown, HTML, ANSI escape sequences, rich formatting, and
  incompatible encodings have not leaked into strict plain-text output.
- Validate that the first two lines are self-contained when using the default
  BBS-compatible profile.
- Validate CP437-compatible or extended-character output in an intended
  monospaced NFO/DIZ-capable viewer before treating Scene-art output as final.
- Validate that no unsafe operational piracy content, private identifiers,
  credentials, IP addresses, download paths, invite paths, or personal data are
  present.
- When documenting DIZ validators, use `MUST`, `MUST NOT`, `SHOULD`,
  `SHOULD NOT`, `MAY`, and `OPTIONAL` according to RFC 2119 semantics.

### Idioms

- Prefer a compact DIZ structure: package name, version when applicable,
  separator, short description, and required disk marker when applicable.
- Mention only information that helps identify the archive quickly, such as
  title, version, format, language, disk count, and a compact description.
- Keep the DIZ concise and use the companion NFO for detailed release notes,
  compatibility notes, credits, history, or longer explanations.
- Preserve required metadata, especially disk or volume count, in a visible and
  machine-checkable form.
- Prefer direct, readable wording over excessive slogans, decorative filler,
  unexplained Scene jargon, or stylized text that weakens identification.
- Use placeholders such as `[xx/??]` only in reusable templates, never in
  finalized DIZ output.

### Other

- Apply this section only to `FILE_ID.DIZ`, `.diz` artifacts, or explicit
  DIZ-style archive description sidecars.
- For `FILE_ID.DIZ`, this section takes precedence over the more general
  Warez Release NFO File section whenever their constraints overlap.
- Apply the most specific applicable DIZ profile first.
- If a category-specific ruleset conflicts with the generic BBS-compatible DIZ
  profile, the category-specific ruleset wins.
- Place `FILE_ID.DIZ` inside the archive when the target packaging profile
  requires archive-embedded metadata.
- For multi-volume ZIP+DIZ packaging, include the applicable `FILE_ID.DIZ` in
  each ZIP volume when required by the active rule profile.
- Ask for missing metadata only when it blocks safe and valid DIZ generation.

## YAML

### Naming

- Prefer `.yaml` for new YAML files unless the target ecosystem requires `.yml`.
- Use `.yml` only when it is already established by the target tool,
  repository, platform, or file set.

### Formatting

- Use spaces for indentation, never tabs.
- Use two spaces per indentation level unless the repository style guide
  explicitly requires another consistent value.
- Keep indentation consistent within the same nesting level.
- Do not mix indentation widths for sibling keys or sibling sequence items.
- Write scalar mappings with exactly one space after the colon, such as
  `key: value`, not `key:value`.
- Prefer block-style mappings and sequences for maintainable configuration.
- Avoid flow-style objects and inline lists for complex or long values.
- Indent sequence items clearly under the key they belong to.
- Do not place sequence dashes at an ambiguous indentation level.
- Use only lowercase `true` and `false` for portable Boolean values.
- Do not use `yes`, `no`, `on`, `off`, `True`, or `False` as portable YAML
  Booleans.
- Quote values that must remain strings when they look like another YAML type.
- Quote numeric-looking identifiers, text Booleans, leading-zero values, and
  other scalars that a parser could coerce.
- Quote fragile scalars that contain YAML-significant characters when the value
  must be parsed as a plain string.
- Quote strings containing a colon followed by a space, a space before `#`, a
  dash followed by a space, control characters, tabs, or flow-style delimiters
  when needed.
- Use single quotes for regular expressions and filesystem paths when escaping
  or parser ambiguity is a risk.
- Use block scalars for long or multiline strings.
- Prefer `|`, `>`, `|-`, or `>-` over embedded `\n` sequences or very long
  single-line strings.
- Keep comments aligned with the YAML block they describe.
- Put comments above the relevant line when possible, start them with `#`
  followed by one space, and avoid unclear comment indentation.
- Remove trailing whitespace from YAML files.

### Errors

- Treat tab indentation, mixed indentation, ambiguous sequence indentation, and
  malformed key-value spacing as defects.
- Treat trailing whitespace as a linting defect because it reduces readability
  and can hide formatting issues.
- Treat unquoted ambiguous scalar values as defects when the target consumer
  must receive a string.
- Do not accept YAML that depends on undocumented parser coercion, syntax
  extensions, or tool-specific behavior.

### Safety

- Do not store secrets directly in YAML files.
- Use a secret manager, keystore, environment integration, or platform-specific
  secret mechanism for sensitive values.
- Use safe YAML loaders for untrusted input.
- Never parse untrusted YAML with loaders, constructors, or tags that can
  instantiate arbitrary objects or execute unsafe behavior.

### Tests

- Validate YAML before committing or deploying it.
- Use `yamllint` as the default first-line YAML syntax and style validator when
  it is installed or provided by the project's toolchain.
- Before presenting YAML changes as final, run `yamllint` against every
  repository YAML file when practical. If full-repository linting is
  impractical, run it against every generated or modified YAML file and state
  why the broader check was skipped.
- Use the repository's existing `.yamllint`, `.yamllint.yaml`, or
  `.yamllint.yml` configuration when one exists.
- Do not disable, relax, or bypass `yamllint` rules to make a change pass unless
  the user explicitly requests that configuration change.
- Treat `yamllint` syntax failures as blocking defects. Treat `yamllint` style
  failures as defects unless they conflict with a verified target-tool
  requirement.
- If `yamllint` is not installed, unavailable, or inaccessible, report that
  limitation and use the best available fallback check, such as a YAML parser,
  schema validator, formatter, or the target tool's native validation command.
- State that fallback validation does not replace a successful `yamllint` run.
- Enforce YAML validation in CI when the repository already has CI or the target
  tool provides a reliable check.
- Validate generated YAML with the exact target tool when using tool-specific
  includes, templates, schemas, or merge behavior.
- Do not treat `yamllint` as schema validation or semantic validation; use it
  together with schema or target-tool checks when correctness depends on keys,
  value types, includes, templates, or platform-specific behavior.

### Idioms

- Keep YAML configuration minimal.
- Do not write default values already supplied by the target tool unless the
  value is intentionally documented, overridden, or tested.
- Use anchors and aliases only when they improve local readability.
- Do not rely on anchors across files unless the target tool explicitly supports
  that behavior.
- Avoid anchor-heavy structures that obscure the final expanded configuration.
- Use ecosystem-specific composition only when the ecosystem supports it.
- Do not treat includes, templates, schemas, or merge behavior as generic YAML
  behavior.

### Other

- Do not generalize framework or platform rules to YAML itself.
- Apply Kubernetes, Home Assistant, dbt, Ansible, GitLab CI, Elastic, or similar
  conventions only inside the matching ecosystem.

## YAML for GitHub Actions

### Naming

- Store GitHub Actions workflow files only under `.github/workflows/` with the
  `.yml` or `.yaml` suffix.
- Give each workflow a clear and unique top-level `name` that describes its
  purpose, such as `CI`, `Release`, `CodeQL`, or `Deploy production`.
- Use descriptive job identifiers for clear pipeline phases, such as `lint`,
  `test`, `build`, `package`, `security-scan`, or `deploy`.
- Use descriptive job and step `name` values so GitHub Actions logs are readable
  without opening the workflow file.
- Use explicit `runs-on` labels that identify the required runner type, and do
  not select self-hosted runner labels accidentally for generic jobs.

### Formatting

- Apply the generic `YAML` rules before applying this GitHub Actions section.
- Use explicit `on` triggers such as `push`, `pull_request`,
  `workflow_dispatch`, or `schedule`; avoid broad triggers that run workflows
  unnecessarily.
- Add branch, tag, or path filters when a workflow applies only to part of the
  repository.
- Define explicit `workflow_dispatch` inputs when a manual workflow needs
  human-controlled parameters.
- Use `concurrency` for deployments, shared environments, release workflows, or
  expensive jobs, with a stable group that prevents race conditions and
  duplicate runs.
- Keep workflow files focused by lifecycle purpose, such as CI, release,
  deployment, scheduled maintenance, or security scanning.
- Model each job as one clear pipeline phase, and do not mix unrelated
  responsibilities inside the same job.
- Use `needs` to express job dependencies; do not rely on YAML order to imply
  execution order between jobs.
- Keep steps atomic and debuggable: checkout, runtime setup, dependency
  installation, linting, testing, building, artifact upload, or deployment.
- Use `strategy.matrix` only when multiple versions, operating systems,
  runtimes, or configurations must be tested.
- Do not add a matrix for a single environment.
- Set `timeout-minutes` on jobs that could hang or consume runner time
  indefinitely.
- Use job outputs for small structured values passed between jobs, such as a
  version, image tag, or generated path.
- Use artifacts only for build outputs that must be shared, reviewed,
  downloaded, or deployed.
- Cache dependency directories only when the cache key is tied to lockfiles or
  equivalent dependency manifests.
- Build cache keys from stable inputs such as `runner.os` and dependency-file
  hashes; avoid cache keys that change on every run.
- Use `restore-keys` only when partial cache reuse is acceptable, and avoid broad
  restore keys when stale dependencies could produce incorrect builds.
- Run cheap validation steps before expensive build, packaging, release, or
  deployment steps.
- Use matrix parallelism only when the workload is safely parallelizable.
- Do not parallelize steps that mutate shared external state unless every worker
  is isolated.

### Errors

- Treat missing or overly broad workflow triggers as defects when the workflow
  should run only for specific branches, tags, paths, events, or manual inputs.
- Treat implicit job ordering as a workflow defect; job dependencies must be
  declared with `needs` when ordering matters.
- Treat missing `timeout-minutes` as a defect for jobs that can hang or run for a
  long time.
- Treat cache keys that are not tied to dependency manifests as defects when
  stale dependencies can change build results.
- Treat artifacts containing secrets, credentials, tokens, private keys, or
  sensitive configuration as blocking defects.
- Treat direct interpolation of untrusted event values inside `run` commands as
  a script-injection defect.
- Treat privileged workflows that check out or execute untrusted pull request
  code as blocking security defects.
- Treat `actionlint` errors as blocking workflow defects unless the user
  explicitly accepts the reported risk.

### Safety

- Define `permissions` explicitly at the workflow level, using a restrictive
  default such as `contents: read`.
- Grant write permissions only to jobs that must write to the repository,
  pull requests, packages, deployments, or another protected resource.
- Do not give `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`, `packages: write`, or
  similar scopes to lint, test, or build jobs unless they require them.
- Store sensitive values only in GitHub Secrets or protected environments.
- Never hardcode credentials, tokens, API keys, certificates, private keys, or
  passwords in workflow YAML.
- Do not rely on GitHub log redaction as the only protection for secrets.
- Avoid printing secrets, transformed secrets, encoded secrets, or structured
  secret blobs to logs.
- Use environment protection rules, reviewers, or approval gates for sensitive
  deployments.
- Prefer OpenID Connect for cloud authentication when the provider supports it.
- Prefer short-lived, scoped cloud credentials over long-lived cloud access keys
  stored as repository secrets.
- Pin third-party actions to a full-length commit SHA; do not use mutable
  references such as `main`, `master`, `latest`, or moving branch names.
- When a pinned action SHA corresponds to a reviewed release or tag, add a
  human-readable version comment such as `# v4.2.2` so the immutable reference
  remains auditable.
- Prefer official GitHub actions or trusted, reviewed actions.
- Before adding a third-party action, verify its maintainer, repository activity,
  release history, and source behavior.
- Do not use an unreviewed marketplace action when a simple shell command or an
  official action is sufficient.
- Track workflow action dependencies through available dependency graph,
  advisory, and security tooling.
- Protect workflow changes with `CODEOWNERS` or equivalent review rules when the
  repository supports protected reviews.
- Avoid `pull_request_target` unless the workflow truly requires privileged
  context.
- Use `pull_request` for normal pull request validation.
- Never combine secrets, write tokens, or privileged triggers with execution of
  untrusted pull request code.
- Treat event payload values such as pull request titles, issue bodies, branch
  names, commit messages, and user-controlled fields as untrusted input.
- Pass untrusted expression values through intermediate environment variables
  before using them in scripts.
- Quote shell variables that contain untrusted values and avoid direct
  expression interpolation inside `run` commands.
- Prefer a dedicated action over inline shell when processing complex untrusted
  input.
- Prefer GitHub-hosted runners for public repositories and untrusted pull
  request workflows.
- Use self-hosted runners only for trusted repositories, trusted workflows, and
  isolated runner groups.
- Do not place long-lived secrets, private keys, or sensitive network access on
  self-hosted runners unless the workflow explicitly requires them.

### Tests

- Apply this section only to GitHub Actions workflow files under
  `.github/workflows/*.yml` or `.github/workflows/*.yaml`.
- Before presenting or committing created or modified GitHub Actions workflow
  files, validate the affected workflow files with `actionlint`.
- Use the repository's existing `actionlint` configuration when one exists.
- If `actionlint` is not installed, unavailable, inaccessible, or unable to
  validate the affected workflow files, explicitly warn the user and use the
  best available fallback validation.
- The fallback validation must include YAML syntax or style validation with
  `yamllint`, a YAML parser, or an equivalent repository tool.
- The fallback validation must also include manual review of GitHub Actions
  workflow syntax, triggers, jobs, expressions, reusable workflow calls, action
  inputs, runner labels, and visible secrets or environment-variable handling.
- State that fallback validation does not replace a successful `actionlint` run.
- Validate deployment, release, privileged, and self-hosted-runner workflows for
  permissions, secrets, concurrency, environment gates, and untrusted-code
  execution before treating them as safe.

### Idioms

- Use reusable workflows with `workflow_call` for repeated CI/CD patterns across
  repositories or workflow files.
- Do not create reusable workflows for one-off logic that is clearer directly in
  the workflow file.
- Keep workflow YAML readable before making it clever.
- Prefer explicit job names, step names, inputs, permissions, environments, and
  runner declarations over dense expressions.
- Document non-obvious workflow decisions inline with short comments, especially
  unusual permissions, privileged triggers, deployment gates, concurrency groups,
  and security exceptions.
- Use starter workflows and examples as templates, not as unquestioned final
  workflows.
- Adapt workflow templates to the repository triggers, permissions, secrets,
  runtime versions, and deployment model.

### Other

- Apply this section in addition to the generic `YAML` section; when the two
  sections overlap, prefer the GitHub Actions-specific rule.
- Do not apply GitHub Actions workflow rules to generic YAML files, Kubernetes
  manifests, GitLab CI files, or other CI configuration formats.
- Do not introduce third-party actions, reusable workflows, self-hosted runners,
  or privileged triggers unless they solve a documented workflow requirement.

## YAML for Kubernetes

### Naming

- Set a stable `metadata.name` explicitly for declarative Kubernetes resources
  stored as source-of-truth manifests.
- Use `generateName` only for short-lived or generated Kubernetes resources
  where stable identity is not required and the deployment flow supports
  generated names.
- Use semantic labels consistently across related Kubernetes resources.
- Prefer standard labels such as `app.kubernetes.io/name`,
  `app.kubernetes.io/instance`, `app.kubernetes.io/version`,
  `app.kubernetes.io/component`, `app.kubernetes.io/part-of`, and
  `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by` when they help ownership, selection,
  observability, cost tracking, environment separation, or tier identification.
- Use annotations for metadata that must survive deployment but should not be
  used for selectors, such as build IDs, commit references, ownership
  information, deployment context, or operational descriptions.
- Keep Service selectors, workload selectors, and Pod template labels aligned so
  that each selector identifies only the intended Pods.

### Formatting

- Generate Kubernetes configuration as YAML by default, not JSON, unless the user
  explicitly requests another Kubernetes-supported format.
- Follow the generic YAML section for indentation, scalar quoting, Boolean
  values, comments, block scalars, and YAML validation before applying
  Kubernetes-specific manifest rules.
- Define the required object fields for every Kubernetes manifest, including
  `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` or a documented `generateName`
  exception, and the resource-specific `spec` when the resource kind requires
  one.
- Use the latest stable API version supported by the target cluster, and verify
  API availability with the target cluster when possible instead of hardcoding
  outdated or deprecated APIs.
- Keep manifests minimal; do not generate fields whose default values are
  already supplied by Kubernetes unless the explicit value improves clarity,
  reviewability, or policy compliance.
- Declare namespaces explicitly for shared, team, staging, and production
  resources; do not rely on the implicit `default` namespace for production or
  multi-team manifests.
- Group tightly related objects together when they are deployed as one
  application unit, and keep unrelated resources separate.
- Separate shared base manifests from environment-specific changes; use
  overlays, patches, Helm values, or an equivalent project-approved mechanism
  instead of copy-pasting full `dev`, `staging`, and `prod` manifests.
- Use YAML comments only for useful human context, such as non-obvious intent,
  constraints, workarounds, or environment-specific decisions.

### Errors

- Treat missing `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata.name` or documented
  `generateName` exception, and required resource-specific `spec` fields as
  manifest defects.
- Treat API versions that are unsupported or deprecated for the target cluster
  as defects when a supported stable replacement is available.
- Treat selector and label mismatches as defects because they can route traffic
  to the wrong Pods or leave workloads unmanaged.
- Treat hardcoded Pod IPs in workload access paths as defects; use Services and
  Service DNS names for stable in-cluster discovery.
- Treat undocumented exceptions to required resource controls, security
  contexts, NetworkPolicy, non-root execution, read-only root filesystems, or
  other project security rules as defects until the exception is recorded close
  to the manifest.

### Safety

- Do not hardcode real sensitive values in Kubernetes manifests; use Secret
  references or an approved external secret manager for passwords, tokens, API
  keys, and certificates.
- Do not commit real sensitive values in Secret `data` or `stringData`; base64
  encoding is not encryption.
- Never commit production secrets as cleartext `stringData`.
- Do not treat namespaces as complete security isolation; combine namespaces
  with RBAC, ResourceQuota, LimitRange, and NetworkPolicy when isolation is
  required.
- Set restrictive security contexts by default for application containers.
- Use `runAsNonRoot`, a non-zero `runAsUser` when applicable,
  `readOnlyRootFilesystem` when compatible, and `allowPrivilegeEscalation:
  false` unless an exception is explicitly documented.
- Do not use privileged or host-coupled settings unless they are required and
  documented.
- Avoid `hostPort` and `hostNetwork` for normal access patterns; prefer
  Services, DNS, or port-forwarding.
- Set CPU and memory requests explicitly for application containers unless a
  `LimitRange`, admission policy, or local policy supplies them.
- Set memory limits and CPU limits when local policy, workload safety, or
  capacity planning requires them, and document intentional omissions.
- Generate NetworkPolicy when workload isolation is required, and do not assume
  that the absence of Service exposure prevents Pod-to-Pod communication.
- Use explicit, versioned, trusted image references; do not assume that floating
  or unqualified image references are safe.

### Tests

- Validate Kubernetes manifests before deployment with the target cluster or the
  target deployment tooling when possible.
- Run `kubectl apply --dry-run=server --validate=strict -f <path>` or the
  equivalent project deployment command when a target cluster is available.
- Lint manifests before deployment with a Kubernetes-aware linter such as
  KubeLinter in local checks or CI, and address findings before applying the
  manifests.
- Gate production manifests with policy-as-code when the project requires
  policies for labels, non-root security contexts, signed images, or similar
  controls.
- Before applying manifests, verify required fields, API versions, namespaces,
  selectors, labels, resource requests, resource limits when required, probes,
  security contexts, Secret references, Service types, and NetworkPolicy
  coverage when relevant.
- Document every intentional exception close to the manifest in an annotation or
  nearby comment so the exception remains reviewable.

### Idioms

- Do not generate naked Pods for production workloads.
- Use a Deployment for continuously running stateless applications, a
  StatefulSet for stateful workloads that need stable identity or storage, and
  a Job for finite tasks.
- Use one main container per Pod unless a sidecar is explicitly justified.
- Do not add logging, proxy, or helper sidecars speculatively.
- Configure readiness probes for traffic admission, liveness probes for
  unhealthy container recovery, and startup probes when slow startup would
  otherwise cause false failures.
- Use Services for stable workload access instead of hardcoded Pod IPs, and
  prefer Service DNS names for intra-cluster discovery.
- Use headless Services only when direct Pod discovery is required.
- Set `clusterIP: None` only for workloads that must discover individual Pod
  addresses instead of using normal load-balanced Service routing.
- Choose Service types deliberately: use `ClusterIP` for internal communication,
  `NodePort` mainly for testing or constrained direct access, and `LoadBalancer`
  for cloud-backed external exposure when appropriate.

### Other

- Apply this section only to Kubernetes manifests and Kubernetes-specific YAML
  configuration.
- Apply this section in addition to the generic YAML section; when the two
  sections overlap, prefer the Kubernetes-specific rule.
- Store source-of-truth manifests in version control before applying them to a
  cluster.
- Do not treat local, untracked YAML files as the source of truth for a
  Kubernetes environment.
- Do not generalize Kubernetes-specific rules to YAML used by unrelated tools or
  platforms.
